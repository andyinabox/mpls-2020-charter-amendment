# Minneapolis 2020 Public Charter Amendment Comments

This is a project dedicated to scraping public comments for the Minneapolis Charter Commission's "Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and violence prevention."

Source: https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/ClerkFile/CF-2020-00007

The source data is in PDF form and this converts it to tabular data.I had also intended to do some more analysis but after reviewing the data I wasn't sure it was helpful.

Results are committed to the repo and included in a public Google Doc:
