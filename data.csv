"6/29/2020 11:56:54 AM",-2,"","","Please do the work to keep our black and brown residence safe from abuse of power but in the same note please keep all residents safe. We need the police force for to fight violent crimes that we have seen increased in our city. Sadly we’ve had an a tick in sexual crimes gang violence etc. Please do the work with the police chief who I fully support and respect to make this city’s please Department into an organization that we as a residence of Minneapolis deserve. Please don’t abolish or defund listen to our mayor and our police chief their ideas of going after the police union and etc From my perspective seems the right way forward. Thanks for giving us residents a chance to be heard."
"6/29/2020 11:57:19 AM",-1,"","","How would we remain safe? Who do we call if there is a break in? A car accident?"
"6/29/2020 12:07:35 PM",-7,"","","I am a proponent of reorganizing police response and providing other community resources. I am against the City Council having final say on these actions. The mayor is more qualified than City Council members and their responsibilities should reflect this. City Council should not be creating the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. There are other more qualified groups than City Council. City Council is not qualified in this space. They have ignored policing issues for years and now are rushing to create change that is not well thought out. I would like to know more specifically how they plan to use their budget before approving a plan. I suggest the Charter Commission reject this proposal as it is a first draft. A first draft should not be going to the ballots. This is chaos and a disaster waiting to happen."
"6/29/2020 12:08:17 PM",-27,"","","This is total insanity!! You should be ashamed of yourselves for even considering this. Don't make policy on an isolated incident (Floyd). Mpls has been under democratic control for 40 years and if there's ""systemic racism"" you need to OWN IT!! Crime has sky rocketed since this proposal, most victims are African American. Police brutality towards blacks is not substantiated in the data and is a false narrative. In 2019, 9 unarmed black men were killed by police, 7500 blacks were murdered, mostly by other blacks. You are jeopardizing the safety of Minneapolis residents, particularly black residents. The response to the looting and rioting was a national disgrace!! You allowed or city to be destroyed by criminals and thugs. Shame on you!"
"6/29/2020 12:12:30 PM",0,"","","If the police are defunded, I will move. Getting my house all ready so I can list immediately. I have lived in Mpls for 45 years and never considered moving before. The city is so much less safe than it was a month ago because of the disrespect of the law and Leo. I cannot imagine what it will become. MPD has an awesome chief and many (most) cops are great. We also need to get homeless encampments away from playgrounds. 2 (reported) sexual assaults at Powderhorn already plus lots of dirty needles where children are trying to play."
"6/29/2020 1:15:11 PM",2,"","","I do NOT want the city charter changed on the whim of the city council members. I believe as citizens that we have the right to have a working police department. I don't believe that we should be going forward with the council's ""no plan"" plan. I am wholeheartedly against this. I support a change in the city charter to give the mayor more power and less from the council itself. I live in the 4th Ward and we really, really need to have a police department — this is real life, not all rainbows and unicorns. I also want to be able to read and analyze their plan before having to vote on a possible change. This plan would have to be fully flushed out with many contingencies to address unintended consequences, etc. I don't feel that this city council is actually capable of doing the serious work that they were elected to do."
"6/29/2020 1:42:12 PM",6,"","","I would like to encourage the Charter Commission to adopt the proposed charter amendment regarding public safety as-is or with minimal amendments such that the Council can accept it and it can be put on the November ballot without delay. As can be seen by the unanimous council vote, this is a high priority item that deserves to be put before the citizens for a vote without delay. The charter amendment is necessary for the Council to make the desperately need changes to the MPD. While the language may seem extreme, the practical effect will be to give the Council latitude to take a variety of steps, and does not oblige it to any single path. Minneapolis has a chance to lead in this area after lagging for so long. I believe many of those arguing against a Charter amendment are doing so from a position of relative comfort (people who have minimal actual interaction with the MPD, or who desire to see the status quo maintained) or who would let the absence of a specific, highly detailed plan for reformation of the police act as an obstacle. However those are ultimately issues that can and should be decided by the voters, and I urge you to allow them that decision. Thank you for your time and consideration."
"6/29/2020 1:49:10 PM",-23,"","","It is very concerning to me that City Council is pushing this proposed amendment through without additional public comment on this matter. Why the rush? Is the council attempting to exploit the citizens of Minneapolis while we are in a state stress and grief and fear? This appears to be an action an intention to exploit vulnerable individuals. It concerns me that a group of 12 people are attempting to make a decision that effects every single resident of this City without public input. There does not appear to be any plan in place. What is this going to cost the citizens? How is this going to impact businesses? Will they leave? Will new businesses want to open? How is this going to impact tourism? Will insurance rates go up? Who is going to benefit and who is going to hurt? Maybe most importantly, do we know how this will impact crime in our city? Will it decrease or increase? I am afraid it will increase. Crime prey on opportunities. A city with no police force will be ripe with opportunities, especially organized crime. It is completely irresponsible to move this forward in any way, shape or form without extensive research and planning. This action must go before the voters before the charter is amended. The escalation in violent crime over the past month is terrifying. The city needs to protect it's citizens. Removing the police department is not the answer."
"6/29/2020 2:11:06 PM",1,"","","To Whom It May Concern: I DO NOT support the amending the City Charter to defund the Minneapolis Police Department. The council has no plan and this is a power grab . The council has failed our city miserably and should not be allowed to continue to do so by allowing this pass. My husband and I grew up in Minneapolis, we are currently raising our own 2 children here . I don't think you understand the amount of concern and stress this has caused my husband or other first responders in his same situation. He see's everything first hand and is so concerned of this move to defund the police department that he wants to move our family out of the city. This situation has consumed him and haunts him. We now live in a city (that we love and are paying tons of taxes) where the city council supports lawless behavior, encourages ""no call"" zones and tells us, the tax payers and city employees that calling the police is a privilege. ............ Last I checked it's our right and we deserve and need to have a solid police department. I wish our city leaders were able to work together and were supportive of each other, instead they want to work against each other. The council is a disappointment and has been incredibly reckless with recent actions and statements. We fully support reform within the police department. Let's have faith in our leaders. The city council clearly has no idea what actually goes on and are not in law enforcement or first responders. Thank you"
"6/29/2020 2:24:14 PM",6,"","","I am opposed to amending the Charter to abolish the police department and replace it with an entity that currently has no further definition, scope, accountability, or purpose. Public Safety is too important to the citizens of Minneapolis to be taken lightly in the course of a political storm. I do support a reorganization of the MPD, with support from the Council, and even folding the police and fire departments into a ""Department of Public Safety"" with a director the police and fire chiefs would report to would be a better idea than what is proposed, with a leader having zero public safety experience."
"6/29/2020 2:44:21 PM",0,"","","I am absolutely against this amendment. I don't the city council put enough time or thought into its formulation and they have not asked us:the people they are supposed to be serving, for our thoughts and input."
"6/29/2020 2:46:08 PM",6,"","","Wake up! Radicals are taking advantage of the situation. Don't allow them to set the narrative. There will be unintended consequences which you cannot even fathom. There is wisdom in reform but DO NOT disband. Unless, of course, you want to drive more people into the small towns of GREATER MINNESOTA. A major city without a PD will soon cease to be a world-class city. A city without a PD will give those in the suburbs and rural MN a reason NOT to visit The Cities for any reason. And then your radical actions will have created an EVEN MORE radical divide between ethnic and socio-economic groups -- the exact opposite of what ALL OF US want to see. I serve as a Township Supervisor. I am an ordained Lutheran Pastor. I am a former resident and homeowner of the Phillips Neighborhood. I have fought for the powerless and been a voice for the voiceless. I have lived in the developing world for 4 years -- including a country without effective government and ruled by tribal forces. I see parallels to my time in East Africa which are striking. You do not want to do this."
"6/29/2020 2:57:02 PM",2,"","","Hello, I support the charter amendment, which provides a path for changing the way that law enforcement happens in Minneapolis."
"6/29/2020 3:00:46 PM",2,"","","I am in full support of the amendment to the charter."
"6/29/2020 3:01:48 PM",4,"","","I am a supporter of defunding our police department. I want to make sure that the new charter ensures that we do not just replace our current police department with one with a different name. Real changes need to ensure that we are serving the members of our community with the most need, and that these new departments are not led by current or former law enforcement officers. We need a radical rethinking of public safety, not just a new name for it."
"6/29/2020 3:02:33 PM",-1,"","","I do not want the Police Department removed."
"6/29/2020 3:02:46 PM",2,"","","I am not in favor of removing police dept!"
"6/29/2020 3:03:16 PM",0,"","","It would be my preference to see a detailed plan and a city-wide referendum for the alternatives before amending the charter. We have not seen either yet so it seems very premature for a change of this magnitude."
"6/29/2020 3:03:50 PM",0,"","","While I support partially defunding the police, I feel like this needs to be a 2-3 year plan, with certain goals to be met each year before moving on to the next phase of defunding. The current state of Uptown, Downtown and residential neighborhoods is completely unacceptable as there are car jackings and shootings happening all the time, even in broad daylight. So we need to get the current crime under control before we think about defunding the police."
"6/29/2020 3:08:19 PM",-2,"","","One of the more asinine things I've ever read. Leave the police as is and start teaching morals in schools. Read Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, and Walter Williams and get over imposing identity politics on all of us."
"6/29/2020 3:09:06 PM",0,"","","I am in full support of the Charter Amendment to remove Police as a Charter Department and introduce a new Department of Community Safety and Violence Protection. For years I have opposed Police as an institution and have always avoided contacting Police in favor of other actions. A new department that better addresses the needs of the community with less violence and without racial disparities would give me so much pride in our City."
"6/29/2020 3:10:44 PM",4,"","","As both a long-time resident of Minneapolis and , I find the proposal lacking in sufficient detail on such an important matter to render it unfit for consideration this fall. I liken the current state of thinking to the cover page only of an important High School or College term paper; there's not even a table of contents to consider much less detailed content to judge. I will submit to the CIty Clerk's Office a set of Principles our organization along with others published on Monday 6/29. One Principle is to maintain clear accountability for police oversight which this proposal muddles, much like the plan the Charter Commission previously expressed concerns about. You were right then. The other clear flaw in this language is the discretionary language regarding the provision of law enforcement services. Law enforcement as one part of a needed continuum of responses for a safe City will be provided for at the whim of each and every City Council from this point forward? Really? For all of these reasons - no substantive details for voters to understand what they would be voting for or against, undermining clear accountability for oversight of safety in our CIty, and the completely untenable notion that law enforcement is a ""may"" item up to future City Councils every term - this proposal must be substantially re-worked before it is ballot ready."
"6/29/2020 3:08:19 PM",-5,"","","I am a proponent of defunding the Minneapolis Police Department (over whatever amount of time it takes), so it can be replaced with something better, more efficient/effective, less expensive, less violent/abusive/racist."
"6/29/2020 3:14:48 PM",-4,"","","I'm against this charter at this time This is a knee jerk reaction and it's totally irresponsible to move forward with this action before having other services in place with a clear understanding of responsibilities and when handoff to other agency/services would take place."
"6/29/2020 3:14:54 PM",5,"","","I am a life long resident of the 3rd precinct neighborhood and was greatly impacted by recent events.I do not support removing the police department/defunding in favor of a ""community safety dept"". Yes we need change at the PD, careful screening/hiring, and education. ability to effectlively deal with problem employees. The alternate path to hiring needs to go away.Adding SW's to team mental health calls etc. As a child protection investigator I have worked coordination with officers for 35 years, our roles are different but our ability to work together is amazing. The council is overstepping in a knee jerk, not thoughtful manner and should not count on being re- elected should they go forward with these efforts."
"6/29/2020 3:15:46 PM",-3,"","","This is a terrible idea and I can't wait to vote against this."
"6/29/2020 3:16:59 PM",-6,"","","Hi, I have concerns about these changes. I firmly believe we need to have reform, but to throw the entire police force out without a plan does not make sense. I live in far north Minneapolis. There have been many instances where I have needed to call the police. For example, I was out walking and witnessed a shooting. Under your plan, who would I call - as I read it there is no plan for those and many other types of calls. We have had our house broken into, the alarm went straight to the police department- under your plan- where would that call go to. As I said at the beginning I firmly believe we need deep reforms but as a resident in an area that is not high crime but we still need help at times this is a scary proposal."
"6/29/2020 3:17:11 PM",3,"","","Hello, I'm a homeowner in Fulton neighborhood and I work at Abbott Northwestern hospital. I have concerns about the charter amendment passed by the city council. Although I am in agreement with the need for deep police reform to address police misconduct and racist policing, and that we should be exploring alternatives to armed officers for certain situations (non violent drug or mental health issues, social welfare checks, etc) I oppose the idea of removing the requirement to have an adequately robust/functional police force in our city. There should be at least some specifics regarding the composition of the replacement police force, minimum number of officers, leadership structure, etc before this is put to Minneapolis voters."
"6/29/2020 3:18:12 PM",-33,"","","I'm 29-years old and have lived in and around the Minneapolis area for my entire life. I'm a licensed attorney and spent over a year at the Washington County Attorney's Office when I was in law school. I saw true evil. Premeditated murder, rape, domestic abuse, child abuse, and other horrific crimes. These weren't caused by a failing society, they were caused by truly evil individuals. I've seen true evil and I honestly don't think the people in favor of this comprehend what will happen. It will only embolden the pr  edators of our society. In the past month, with the increased hostility and violence, especially aimed at police officers, I've watched my city become a hellscape. Shootings are drastically up. Robberies and carjackings are drastically up. The path to Hell was paved with good intentions. If you eliminate the ""thin blue line,"" more violence will occur not less. I will not standby as politicians, who have taxpayer funded- security details, deprive the innocent civilians of protection. This is foolish and dangerous."
"6/29/2020 3:16:59 PM",-6,"","","I want to fix the police department, including getting rid of the mediation that allows cops who are fired to get their jobs back. I think we need to get rid of Bob Kroll and the police union that protects bad cops. I think Chief Arradondo is a good police chief and I would like him to be able to continue to run his department, with radical changes made to that department. I do not think that the safety of police department should report to all of the city council members - that is a freaking nightmare waiting to happen. No one can have that many bosses. People are different and are not always going to agree, so how can anyone report up to so many people? I think we have to change the training, and stop giving police ""warrior"" attitudes and ""warrior"" equipment. The police should have to live in the city they are police in. Hearing the cops from the union talk about how they have to live elsewhere so they don't see anybody they've arrested was disgusting. If you were serving and protecting instead of tackling and choking, maybe you wouldn't mind seeing the people of your community. Mostly we need to get rid of the union because I see a lot of the rot coming from that direction. We need more diversity in the police officers."
"6/29/2020 3:20:32 PM",-2,"","","I fully support disbanding of the police. Thank you for your hard work and for pushing to do the right thing. I have been a victim of crime several times and police have never been able to prevent or aid in any of those situations. We need to refocus our resources to community led programs. Thank you again."
"6/29/2020 3:20:34 PM",-2,"","","This proposal appears to take power from the mayor and to the city council, is that correct? Why is there not a term limit on the Director of Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department or Director of Law Enforcement Services?"
"6/29/2020 3:21:24 PM",-3,"","","I fully support the proposed amendment to remove the Police Department and establish a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department, as an urgently needed first step towards creating an actively anti-racist city in which residents are safe and receive the services they need. At this time, given the well-documented history of police brutality against Black people, the Police Department is not a viable way to meet that goal and is causing significant damage to the city as a whole. The proposed Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department is a practical, feasible way to move forward."
"6/29/2020 3:24:18 PM",2,"","","I am FULLY AGAINST the Mpls City Council being in complete control of any Policing or any version thereof. It is imperative this vote be put on a ballot and worded very very clearly so that anyone can understand the verbiage even those with comprehension challenges. Wording MUST BE CLEAR"
"6/29/2020 3:24:19 PM",2,"","","I believe that it would be wrong to remove the Minneapolis Police Department I do agree that reform needs to be made and some of the ideas outlined could be incorporated into the current MPD structure. Please do not unfund the Minneapolis police department. thank you"
"6/29/2020 3:24:28 PM",-5,"","","I am all for the removal of the MPD as we know it. It is fatally flawed and built to protect the unjust cops on the force and to unfairly target BIPOC in the community. It is time for drastic measures. I am ashamed of the force sworn to protect and to serve me, my family, my neighbors, and my city."
"6/29/2020 3:24:47 PM",0,"","","Absolutely opposed. I live in Southwest, work in Diamond Lake/Hale, and own property all over Minneapolis. It's difficult now to get timely police response, especially in Sothwest, far South and Northeast. In addition, voting on a change in the Charter without a firm plan as to what we're voting on is madness. What does the Council have in mind? It's foolish to vote on something of such great consequences without knowing the details of the proposal. This is an important issue, but deserves more detail and input."
"6/29/2020 3:28:35 PM",-23,"","","I approve of this amendment. I would like to see policing as we know it abolished in Minneapolis. I have not seen MPD be effective at curbing traffic violence, recovering stolen property, or helping individuals who need help. I have seen MPD harass and abuse poor, homeless, and Black people all the time. I’ve encountered several officers who don’t even know the law, and have argued to me that they can break  the law because they are police officers. I want my tax money to go to actual crime prevention: by addressing poverty, failings in education, and systemic inequality. I want compassionate traffic enforcement that prioritizes the safety of the most vulnerable people using our roads (pedestrians, cyclists, and the disabled), which will never be achieved with a department whose officers routinely speed, illegally park on sidewalks and bikeways, and disobey other traffic ordinances themselves. I want to see tense and dangerous situations handled by people who have the training to handle them and are accountable for their actions. I never want to see lethal force used on civilians who do not pose an immediate lethal threat to others, and certainly not until after every other option has been exhausted. I want real justice for the community, not the punitive system that currently treats poverty as evil and Black bodies as disposable. I want people who are invested in the well-being of Minneapolis (especially its most disadvantaged residents) to be in charge of keeping it safe, rather than the current department with a culture of hatred and demonization toward our city and its residents. I hope we can create something that works for the people of Minneapolis, rather than against them."
"6/29/2020 3:29:37 PM",-7,"","","I support the amendment. I believe the city council needs more legislative authority in regards to community safety, and that this amendment is the only way to facilitate this. The police department currently operates unlike any other aspect of Minneapolis government. There has been an inability for the city council to reform the police department because of the restrictions in the city charter. The charter needs to be amended. It is critical for the charter commission to weigh the fact that the city council has been unanimous in its desire to move forward. It is critical for the charter commission to listen to the wishes of the Black community. Personally, my interactions with police have been for issues that do not required an armed police response. I do not need armed police to arrive after my car has already been broken into, or after my car has already been hit, or after my apartment building has already been broken into, or when I find stolen property on the street. These things could all be handled by different city services. The city council has been clear that safety of citizens will always be a priority, that someone will always be there to answer 911, and that the police department won't be dissolved until a replacement has been planned. There is no shortage of information available from the city council or from organizations demanding this change. The fear, uncertainty, and doubt about this change are being sown only by the willfully ignorant, those with a vested interest in the broken status quo, and outsiders who do not live in Minneapolis, and should have no say in our city government."
"6/29/2020 3:30:32 PM",6,"","","I am in full support of the change to the charter and associated deconstruction of the current police system. I am a resident of Minneapolis and want to ensure this will help keep our community safe. Please do not allow current people in leadership roles at MPD transition to the new system. This will do more harm to an already traumatized community."
"6/29/2020 3:31:13 PM",-8,"","","The most ridiculous, hysterical proposal and idea EVER from government. YES, Minneapolis needs reforms and changes made to OUR tax-provided police department, but this idea is dumb and a rush to make it appear that Mpls. is doing something about a long-overdue problem. We still need police, we just need better public servants who understand the concept of protect and serve and a system that monitors and supports that mission. STOP spending time on slick-sounding proposals. And most importantly get the damn guns off the streets!"
"6/29/2020 3:33:15 PM",-18,"","","Even before the murder of George Floyd I was shocked and appalled by the flagrant abuses of power I saw the police committing both on public transportation and on the streets. The behavior of the police during the protests only furthered my belief that the Minneapolis Police Department poses a greater threat to my community than any other group in this city. I watched as they brutalized protesters, aiming and shooting weapons directly into the faces of the people they have sworn to protect. I watched as they singled out media and protest medics specifically for harassment and violence. I could not sleep at night as the helicopters buzzed my neighborhood, and for fear that if I did have to go outside, I would be tear gassed and shot at by the police and national Guard. I have been a resident of the twin cities for two years and a resident of Minneapolis for one. My trust in the MPD is irrevocably broken. I do not trust them, I strongly believe that calling 911 puts my community at greater risk than any personal danger I may be in and I ask that the city of Minneapolis abolish the police and institute a holistic set of agencies to bring my community the peace and healing we need. We do not need these monsters that have spent the last 4 weeks holed up behind barricades, we do not need people who can murder with impunity. We will keep each other safe, please help us do that."
"6/29/2020 3:36:12 PM",-2,"","","After reading the proposal, I have found it to vague. What it replaces is a simple equation with a vague equation on what/where resources will be spent. The council could spend anywhere from 0$ up to an infinite amount. The proposal should outline at a high level, the minimum overall funding via a similar equation, for the entire Department. Then the proposal should include a list of the sub-department that will be created in this new department and how they will be funded. We need to see something more than a wish list. We need to see some level of hard numbers so we know how many social workers, how many administrators, and how many peace officers will be present. Right now the way the amendment is worded, we could end up with zero peace/police officers which would be a disaster to the quality of life and would force people with means to move out of the city. Lastly, the person should not be reporting to or appointed by the city council. It should be an individual appointed and reporting to the mayor for accountability. If the person reports to the city council, there will be no accountability. Bottom line. It feels rushed and the council wants it on this years ballot to prevent it being on the ballot the same year they are up for election. If this is not done correctly, the city will fall apart and never recover (see Detroit)"
"6/29/2020 3:37:52 PM",6,"","","I am strongly in favor of the charter amendment to remove the Police Department and create a new Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department. It is clear that the Minneapolis Police Department is a systemically racist organization that cannot be reformed. I want to live in, and I want my taxes to support, a city that provides safety to all residents and does so based on racial equity. I want to see dollars invested directly in communities of color and marginalized communities through direct payments and services that are asked for and provided by trusted members of that community."
"6/29/2020 3:38:12 PM",-1,"","","I believe major reform to the police department is necessary. I also believe that not all police are bad, however, there are more than a few 'bad apples'. If it were just a few, like 1%, we would not have the issues of community trust that we currently have. I think that the Camden, NJ model where they interviewed and rehired the desirable police officers, would be helpful. I believe in reform where there are certain service calls where trained social workers could respond alone or with an officer. Changing some of the state statues could also help. We need more police officers that live in the city (not necessarily in the percent they patrol). I think when you don't live in the city, you can get an ""us versus them"" type of mentality among the force. I have heard of officers telling their suburban neighbors ""I have to go to work today in the jungle"". I do think it is ridiculous to eliminate the police department entirely. If this occurs, I will likely move out of Minneapolis and will not visit restaurants, theaters, sporting events, festivals, etc. due to the lack of safety. I'm concerned that eliminating the charter requirement for a set number of police officers could lead to this."
"6/29/2020 3:40:12 PM",6,"","","I am fully in favor of placing this amendment on the ballot this November! Police do not keep us safe, and actively cause harm to so many people in our community. We need a new vision of what public safety looks like and a new system to achieve it, and that starts with this amendment. Our community can't wait any longer for real change that will really keep us safe."
"6/29/2020 3:40:40 PM",-3,"","","I think a good hard look needs to be taken at how the city/civilians have already responded to police taking a step back/step down. The overall feel of the city is complete lawlessness. Time needs to be taken and these decisions should not be made hastily. Take time and think about a solid plan before moving forward, in any direction. Take time to hear from the silent majority of the city that do not feel safe with the snap decisions being made. The amount of crime in and around my neighborhood has sky rocketed in the past month, and innocent people are already dying from individuals feeling like they can drive/run around and just start shooting their guns off. It’s terrifying what has become of the city and the fact that the police department has had no back up given by the chiefs, mayor or governor. This is the main reason why people believe the city has no laws and will continue to murder and shoot people daily."
"6/29/2020 3:41:46 PM",0,"","","absolutely not. I would not feel safe bringing my children to the cities if the police are no longer there. I also have family that lives in the area."
"6/29/2020 3:41:47 PM",7,"","","I am very strongly against this change in the charter because I do not trust our City Council to take on more authority and to create and oversee an entirely new infrastructure. We need a change in governance with either a City Administrator or stronger Mayor that can work with the current Police Chief to actually create a workable solution that would provide for appropriate levels of security and safety for all residents. This attempt to change the charter on such a fast track with no actual experience by any of the City Council members is extremely misguided and should not pass. Thank you."
"6/29/2020 3:43:31 PM",-9,"","","No the police should not be defunded. Crime was already hideous before, it will only get worse if you defund. I have to work down there, and I can guarantee you I'll retire and never set foot in Minneapolis again if you defund."
"6/29/2020 3:43:42 PM",10,"","","While I participated in the protests over George Floyd’s killing and I believe serious reform is needed, I do not approve of this approach. I believe that the city council has been extremely negligent with its messaging on the topic and is over-reaching in this and other areas. Until a solid plan is in place, with measured, sequenced steps that move us toward a more equitable environment while ensuring the safety and vitality of our city, I cannot support a move to strip us of our police department. I would support diversion of some funds to community service personnel who would respond to non- emergency calls. I would support renegotiation of the contract with the police union to make it easier to fire problem officers. I would support requiring officers to cover the costs of their own insurance and reimbursing them only to the median cost for all officers. I do support our current police chief and our mayor.

Furthermore, before I can consider voting on this issue, I would like answers to the following questions: 1) Will the police officers with records that suggest they are unfit for duty be fired? 2) Will the police officers with records that suggest excellence be affected by the defunding, if so how? 3) What evidence is there to suggest that defunding the MPD will lead to safer outcomes for all citizens of Minneapolis, including POC? 4) What evidence is there to suggest that defunding the MPD will lead to dangerous outcomes for all citizens of Minneapolis, including POC? 5) How exactly will the Department of   Community Safety and Violence Prevention bolster community safety and prevent violence? 6) Why is this action being considered over the complete gutting of the MPD and immediate recruitment of a brand new police force, with the exception of MPD employees that have an acceptable record of service as defined by the citizens of Minneapolis?    At face value, this charter amendment appears to be a vague knee-jerk reaction and an attempt to satisfy the local community, without serious consideration of the long-term impacts on Minneapolis and its citizens. The consequences of the decisions this City Council makes on this issue, for better or for worse, will forever be tied back to its members. I am no expert in this complicated issue, though I am also not an idiot. When our founding fathers declared independence, they took great care in addressing every possible outcome to ensure the safety and longevity of this country. Before you make such a dramatic change to how the City of Minneapolis, one of the top cities with respect to crime in the United States, manages the enforcement of the law, I sure do hope you know exactly what you are doing. Lives depend on it, as does the future of this city. Please take this seriously. I do not mean to say that the MPD should not be defunded, however, I am asking that you research this issue far more in-depth than you have already. If you present this to the public without careful consideration AND educating voters on the true pros and cons, the results may be dangerous. Should there be an outcome that leads to negative outcomes for Minneapolis and its citizens, especially POC, the people will blame its leaders."

The department can work on much needed changes, but to remove the police from the city charter is a dangerous and short sighted idea that will be fraught with much unintended consequences down the road.

If something like this was passed, I believe we'd have instantaneous increases in current MPD staff leaving their jobs, leaving the city in a lawless free-for-all.

It seems the City council is reacting to feelings around a very charged subject, but have not actually thought through the possible implications. Implications that not only impact Minneapolis proper, but other communities surrounding the city.    This announcement has already sent a message throughout the Twin Cities that ""crime is free"", with an unprecedented number of gun incidents, car jackings, riots and looting, assaults, and murders. This will only increase if this idea is allowed to continue. And should this be allowed to go on a ballot, and god forbid it is passed, you will see an equally unprecedented exodus from the Twin Cities. Property values will plummet in Mpls, and suburbs taking huge hits as well. This Community department will be ill-prepared to handle the types of calls they will be forced to experience. I fear this move will simply create more victims than an actual ""Protect and serve"" department. As a resident of Columbia Heights, I am increasingly fearful of the rampant violence spreading through the Twin Cities and intend to defend my home and my family. I am equally fearful of the repercussions of defending myself, given the current climate in these Twin Cities. It appears the local governments look down upon it's law abiding and tax paying base, while reacting to emotionally charged stories. This short sighted and ill-informed Mpls City Council is embarking on a dangerous and likely lethal journey - disbanding the only line standing between peace and anarchy.

Would city council people be in charge? Good luck with that. Will each citizen get private security paid for by the city? I don't think so. Revamp, retrain, and hold officers accountable. There are many people wanting to be police, so just go through every officer's file and get rid of the ones with complaints.

I have seen videos of Uptown & downtown with traffic jams & burnouts & wonder how its been allowed to happen even once moreless every weekend. The graffiti, the destruction, the constant shootings. If you guys have answers on how to deal with the crime without police-why havent you used those tools to address the crime amongst the youth. We have a major problem with 17-19yr olds & continued crime. Do we have to wait to dismantle police to deal with that issue? Let's address & get that under control.

Instead as currently written it allows the possibility for a department to be created and funded by the City Council but does not guarantee such a department.    The use of ""shall"" as the obligatory subjunctive implies that the city council must provide for a department of ""community safety and violence prevention"" and does not allow a potential loophole to circumvent such measures.  If you remove the police, you must provide each resident with the same armed security as the city council. Removing the police will only escalate crime, especially violent crime.

I partnered with several while working in social services that notably have had a positive impact, and I think that they should be an example of how to police correctly and show others how to do the same- in a kind trauma-informed way. Namely- these individuals are: Lt. Grant Snyder, jefferey Webb, Yolanda Wilkes, Scott, and Davis (outreach team). Please consider letting them set an example for the rest of the force, who greatly need direction. Our officers often work outside the scope of their practice, dealing with individuals with mental health issues and chemical dependency, and they are ill equipped and untrained to deal with. Please take into consideration the lack of space and commitment from area hospitals and detox areas, when properly dealing with individuals. We need space and people who are properly trained to address people who formerly would have been arrestees. I do not feel that their illnesses are issues that warrant arrest, but our current system is not set up to give them adequate care. Please investigate the responses of hospitals and such, when officers have chosen diversion and brought people in for care. I would love to be able to be a part of training existing officers, who are truly there for the right reasons and care about the community. I have worked with Lt.

"6/29/2020 4:20:18 PM",13,"","","This amendment is being rushed to get on the November ballot and not thought through. There is no plan in place and the current proposal is ambiguous. Until it is clear that a well written amendment that is capable of protecting the Minneapolis citizens the amendment should not be on a ballot. The idea that the 13 member city council should be in charge of a department that has to make quick decisions is absurd. The amount of dysfunction and confusion this would cause is enormous. This alone should have more than a few weeks to flesh out how the proposed amendment would function. It  is  concerning  that  a  non-law  enforcement  individual  would  head  the  department.  How  could  that  person possibly know the stresses of being a peace officer and make appropriate decisions in light of that?  Who decides what ""adequately fund"" means in this amendment? The current charter makes it abundantly clear. Leaving this type of ambiguity in the portion of the charter that is to make our city safe is reckless. And to be reckless with safety of the citizen's of Minneapolis is unfathomable to me. Whatever changes need to be made need to carefully considered and vetted before putting them to a vote.  This amendment was quickly thrown together to change who has he power over public safety.  If it was not a power play, they could absolutely work with the mayor to get changes they want within the confines of the current charter. Instead, they have carelessly thrown something together that threatens the safety and financial stability of Minneapolis. What about the financial ramifications? Will we get a Super Bowl without a police force? Will we get a political convention? Has any of this been addressed with the Minneapolis Citizens? If an amendment is to be put to a vote, it should be well thought out and decisive. This important portion of the charter needs time to be carefully considered and written.

Because you basically gave the green light to criminals when you allowed the 3rd precinct to be destroyed, crime has been out of control. There has to be a way to get rid of bad police and provide more training for the good ones. Working with the community is great, but they can’t be in charge. They aren’t qualified to deal with the amount of daily violence and you know it. It appears that local news stations are downplaying the situation, but we know what’s happening - increased shootings, stabbing, carjackings, armed robberies, assaults, looting, vandalism. If you let Minneapolis to fall due to a lack of real police presence, your crime will spread into surrounding communities.

The way the police operate as of this moment, disgusts me and the majority of the population unfortunately. The police need to have a small focus(mainly violent crime, apprehending KNOWN criminals, not some poor soul walking down the street they THINK looks like a criminal.) Retrain, defund, de-militarize(can’t believe I even have to say this one, it’s common sense, but common sense is not very common these days). The more I write the more this conversation angers me.

If the answer is improve or replaced how will it be funded.  My biggest concern is twofold (1) is the police union and its leadership really representative of the rank and file.

"6/29/2020 4:23:58 PM",-46,"","","I’d like to begin by saying I am a lifelong Minnesota resident, I do not live in Minneapolis but I am a resident of its suburbs. That being said, that does not mean that the actions of those who live in Minneapolis do not impact my life. The death of George Floyd was tragic, unacceptable and disgusting, there is no justification that can be made for the suffering the officers put him through. They all deservingly were fired and hopefully will face justice. We as residents of Minnesota need to hold our officers accountable for their actions, in much the same way that us workers are held accountable at our jobs. The city council however, is not discussing accountability they are discussing a radical referendum that very well may destroy Minneapolis. With no clear plan, abstract wording and empty promises, this council has incited a mob of lawlessness onto the Metro Area. Not to mention the hypocrisy of hiring private security on tax payer with tax payer dollars when those very same dollars are going to be taken away from protecting the citizens who pay for protection from the police. It is no coincidence that in the time since the city council announced their vote and intention to disband the police force, that crime has risen to historic levels in Minneapolis. The good officers of the law are being treated in a horrific way and are now scared to do their jobs for fear of their lives being ruined and because of this the people of Minneapolis have suffered. Minority communities are being torn apart by violence in the recent weeks. Normally safe, social areas have been turned into places where no one wants to go, I’m speaking of Uptown, a normally safe area to grab dinner or experience nightlife, when safe of   course. Businesses are closing their doors because of violence. This has all happened in the past month and the way things are going I don’t foresee this getting any better. There are arguments saying that recent crime is proof the police do not help with violence prevention; instead only in violence response. I’d disagree, the presence of police has always been a disincentive for people to commit crime. Criminals and opportunists have been emboldened by the current state of policing in America to increase their violent behavior because there have been no consequences as of late. Gun sales to citizens are at record highs and homes in Minneapolis are going up for sale at incredible rates. This won’t prevent death and violence in the community, this will just bring more. The police need to stay, there needs to be reform, huge reform, there needs to be accountability and change from top to bottom. But to insist that we tear it down and get rid of it all is just appeasement to a mob of people not speaking for the majority. This is not something that should even be up for debate, special resources should he allocated to help with those dealing with mental issues because obviously an officer with a gun isn’t always the answer, we should have more Minneapolis residents being Minneapolis cops, we should have more officers of color helping in communities of color. What we need are good police, what we need is a relationship between those in power and those who are not. Those 12 city council members do not speak for the entirety of the 400,000+ residents of Minneapolis, or Hennepin county. As someone who loves the Twin Cities, and as someone who wishes to continue living here for the rest of my life I implore you to strike down the farce. We need a system that can work for everyone, what we don’t need is a radical decision that could potentially destroy the very city that we all want to protect and see flourish."

Lawlessness. I have lived in downtown Minneapolis for 15 years and it's clear to anyone with any common sense the city needs more police. Rejecting federal funding for more police was, I thought, the stupidest thing city leaders could have done, but this tops that for sure. Defunding the police won't hurt somebody like me. I can leave. I feel bad for residents who do not have the resources to leave. The squalor and lawlessness the leaders of Minneapolis are creating is truly sad. True  leaders  hold  themselves  accountable.

The City Council has been making decisions that encourage more crime like their no bail idea and reducing arrests for what they call ""livability crimes"". I retired from working Downtown at the end of 2014 and crime was bad during rush hour and nights then, but has gotten much worse since. We need more police not less to get this city back on track. Please reject their proposal and send it back to them for a full study with a more comprehensive plan before anything like this goes on the ballot.

It makes more sense to implement laws and change things within the police department.

Hopefully you have a plan in place so as not to jeopardize the safety of   social workers. I want to continue visiting Minneapolis....I love the city. I also agree with the need for reform.

I also see no move to provide additional mental health resources for the MPD who have to deal with the worst life situation so that the people can be safe. I also do see any plan to handle gang and cartel violence. If the city denied the money for more officers in 2019, why haven't they come up with a solid solution? Also, it is highly likely that they will be civil unrest until and during the trial of the 4 officers. Is there a plan to keep people safe then? This seems like a knee-jerk reaction and now the schools have gotten rid of the SRO's and I have yet to hear a plan to make up for this in case of an attack on students. Not all school attacks have been by the actual students. I fear for the physically impaired students who will be in the line of fire but the schools have yet to answer me on their safety plan. All of these decisions seem to rest with a few and it's absolutely frustrating. Hire better officers. Provide better training. Provide mental health resources for the officers and the community."

We could be the first major city to introduce UBI(Universal Basic Income) for Minneapolis residents. The $200 million that will be defunded from police can partially go towards that. People commit crimes due to poverty, lack of income, and desperation. If people and youth have a UBI to spend on their dreams and necessities, why would they commit crimes? They would not have time to. If you want to rehire mpd when they're dismantled, the officer must have 0 complaints and 0 lawsuits filed against them. That includes any scared citizen who never reported an officer. Release all police information to the public so citizens can come foward against police brutality. Also 24/7 video and audio recordings of every police shift has to be on and publicly available after every shift. If not turned, the office has to be written up and fired if involved in an incident that was not recorded. Police in Minneapolis MUST be licensed like nurses, doctors, hair dressers. No exceptions. Police in Minneapolis must be individually insured as a whole and not paid for by city taxpayers. Minneapolis must be required to background check any new police hires from previous police jobs complaints and made public. End qualified immunity in Minneapolis for police, Colorado already has.

Crime is going to go up and I doubt a criminal isn’t going to be afraid of some social worker. Police brutality is a problem but statistically it doesn’t happen that often out of millions of interactions with police each year. Why don’t you go after police unions that keep bad cops on a payroll? I just found out you all got private security. Hypocrites."

"6/29/2020 4:38:58 PM",-44,"","","As Minneapolis citizens we need to be protected from those who are violent. The fact is there are people out there that others need to be protected from. Sending civil servants into situations that are violent without protection will put them and others at risk. We currently have police per capita that is way lower than other cities like New York, Detroit, Chicago, etc. We need more protection than what is currently available. I believe that we do incarcerate too many people for small non-violent crimes but we also need to punish people for violent crimes harsher than we do. There are repeat violent offenders that keep getting out and this is not a fault of the police but the fault of prosecutors and judges. No system is perfect and I don't think many would argue that reform and constant improvement is a good think. That does not mean that we should abolish the police. Currently people are scared to the core by increased violence and a potentially violent future. We cannot let the small amount of extreme people and anarchists that want to remove the police affect the majority. We can see the issues with what happened in CHAZ/CHOP in Seattle. I understand the desire to make change when a tragic event like the killing of George Floyd happens. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme. I am sure that when you make a large decision that may be a little impulsive because of the current climate that it is hard to pull back. Now that we have had time for the dust to settle we need to really think about what is being proposed and not double down on a pour decision. It is more respectable to admit the error and come up with other reform than dig a deeper hole. I also know that the City does not want to pay out lawsuits due to poor police practices. The amount of tax revenue that will be lost without police will be astronomical. People will move, large corporations will relocate, and Minneapolis will become isolated from surrounding cities that have police. This will lead to lawsuits from citizens, local businesses, and surrounding cities because Minneapolis cannot keep people and property safe.  As Minneapolis tax payers, we are currently paying for private security for City Counsel members. The rest of us cannot afford that luxury and we need to feel protected. The sounds of guns recently has increased what seams like exponentially. Removing the police will increase violence in already violent areas as there will be no repercussions. All citizens will be affected but I would argue that people who are already impoverished and in poor neighborhoods who need the most protection will be impacted the worst."

The local governance should be removed from their positions immediately before a real catastrophe emerges.

Instead, the police force should be reformed and especially the union contract that makes it exceedingly difficult to discipline and/or remove a police officer who hasn’t lived up to the standards of the department. The arbitration proceedings too often protect officers who should be disciplined or removed from their position. However, a police force that does meet standards is necessary. The small business owners along Lake Street who had lost their businesses and thus their livelihoods due to looting and arson attest to the need. The nearly fifty percent increase in gunfire since the George Floyd incident attest to the need. The eleven people either killed or injured by gunfire in the middle of Uptown on a weekend evening attest to the need for a police presence. One of the primary public goods that Minneapolis residents pay for through their property taxes is for safety and security. It was not until a much greater security force was provided by support from the Minnesota National Guard did we see the violence abate. Unfortunately, that wasn’t until after much damage had been done to countless businesses both small and large. All of us need to feel safe and secure whether at home, at our office or while shopping or having dinner. Please seek reform and not abolishment of the Minneapolis police department and do not place a charter amendment on the ballot."

Yes there are a small percentage of bad cops. Yes, the MPD needs to be able to get rid of these bad cops when they are deemed as such. But this is a two way street. The culture and attitude in Minneapolis has shifted to crime and violence and it starts with parenting, education, and social services being improved. Instead of all the money that will be spent ""developing"" a new law enforcement system, take that money and improve your schools, improve support systems for families that depend on it. FINALLY start taking that seriously.  Disbanding police is not going to solve your crime. It's not going to help the neighborhoods that are enveloped in crime and violence. Your city will shrivel up unless the violence is controlled. People who normally visit Minneapolis do not feel safe there, myself included. Your businesses will suffer (already are), close (already are) and your streets will become abandoned and only crime will exist. I beg you to reform not reinvent the police department.

"6/29/2020 5:01:26 PM",27,"","","First impressions are -- it looks great! I especially like the line stating that ""Individuals eligible to be appointed as director will have non-law enforcement experience in community safety services, including but not limited to public health and/or restorative justice approaches.""  I do have questions about how you are defining ""peace officers"" and what you envision their role being.  For example: are they armed? How will they be deployed? Will they have stronger legal restrictions on the use of lethal force? etc. I may comment again later as I continue to educate myself and gain a better understanding of the challenges our city is facing --    until then, keep up the good work and do your best to help the people panicking about the end of the MPD understand that their communities will still be safe and in some cases even safer after we transition."

Every resident will be packing guns and it will be a royal shootout if an assault, robbery, murder, etc. happens. I hope residents leave and businesses leave your City, because of how this place is run. The Democrats will ruin a perfectly good city because of their stupid ideations you have created.

"6/29/2020 5:03:07 PM",-2,"","","I am very much in favor of eliminating the current Minneapolis Police force for a community based violence prevention and crisis response approach. I think having a staged approach to situation response has proven to be necessary in Minneapolis due to the complex situations that are present here. Crisis response should start with community emergency resources which can then reach out to a larger community for responding resources, then as a last resort an armed highly trained and supported unit for extreme situations with appropriate mental and physical support in place for officers here. Current police are overworked and stressed without support for the physical and mental drain they experience on a daily basis. Offloading some of this work to funded, prepared, and localized response units will allow police officers to do their jobs more effectively and help them stay healthy along side the communities they serve. We currently have a system that makes the police responsible for responding to all situations, which is frankly not appropriate. It is a stress on the officers, stress on the community, and leads to inappropriate and dangerous actions of force from the police towards citizens. A community oriented, preventative, and harm reduction approach is necessary for our current society."

"6/29/2020 5:03:56 PM",7,"","","Minneapolis City Council members - My husband and I are long-time residents of Southwest Minneapolis in the Tangletown area. Like you, we are horrified by the recent events in Minneapolis and agree that modifications to our policing policies and training must be achieved and that new approaches will likely provide better solutions for our community. Our city leadership and police leadership need more authority and mandate to fire, demote and prosecute officers when they step outside their protocols and quite likely a tiered model of policing may be feasible. That said, your position that you intend to ‘dismantle’ the police force in Minneapolis is abhorrent to most of us who live here. I ask that you please represent the voice of your constituents and do not move quickly to overhaul or even substantively modify the police force or authority without a solid, community reviewed and approved plan. I have not met or talked to one person in Minneapolis who felt that the rapid decision- making we are hearing is coming from the Council is a good thing. Most in my community fear that you will take your authority and make things far worse, choosing fast over well-conceived. Even during COVID, I have active discussions and meetings with local and remote individuals. The topic of what the     Minneapolis City Council is doing often comes up and people ask what is going on with our City leadership. I’m embarrassed to explain to friends and colleagues that I have no idea – that your thoughts do not represent the people of Minneapolis and that I hope the Minneapolis Council will reconsider any rush to change. Put a real, vetted plan in place and then put it to a vote.  Please provide a voice for those that you have been elected to represent vs. embracing a knee-jerk reaction to the current climate."

As a business owner in NE Minneapolis I have always had a good relationship with the police department. We do need to talk about reform but abolishing the police is a major mistake and Will not work well at this time.

"6/29/2020 5:04:28 PM",-16,"","","Defunding the police is ridiculous. If you're following the Camden model then you'll fire them all and hire the majority back at less pay PLUS an additional 125%. I think better training would be much more beneficial. Also we should be firing officers with multiple excessive force complaints. When Arrandondo tried hiring 400 police by 2025 he was denied by the city (and he had secured federal funding for it). Shootings, murder and violence are out of control in Minneapolis. Businesses downtown reported being down year over year in 2019 before Covid-19 because of crime. In 2019 in Minneapolis 6,700 calls to 911 went unanswered. Some of my favorite restaurants are downtown. One, Fogo De Chao had a shooting right out front. Crave had a shooting on the rooftop seating area. I no longer support these places because I don't feel safe going downtown anymore.

Require paperwork forcing them to describe what non lethal forces they tried from training before using their handgun. 5. Make complaints against officers public record and do not allow them to get rehired if they are fired. 6. If a police officer is accused of a crime they should be arrested and booked like any other citizen without pay. 7. All police cars should be clearly and brightly marked. 8. The police budget should be cut in half along with the size of the force. The other half of the money should be spent on counsellors, and mental health professionals within the same building who can respond to appropriate 911 calls. Dispatch should undergo new training to send the appropriate professional to the scene (if not a counsellor along with an officer, with the officer ONLY supporting). Any additional funds should go to programs to reduce crime at its source. 9. Police departments should report to their chief and then the Mayor in that order. 10. Any commander that is found to be extorting their aid based on personal, political, or   monetary reasons (which has been happening for years) should be fired immediately. 11.

"6/29/2020 5:05:50 PM",-10,"","","Police Officers are needed on the streets to assist with specific programs. COPE, mental health professionals, would respond to EDP and crisis calls alone before the Co-responder program was set in place. Many of these mental health professionals did NOT feel safe without having a police Officer escort and for multiple reasons. Calls for service where subjects are in crisis can escalate quickly. Most of the mental health professionals see clients In an office setting and not on the streets where a subject in crisis is running around completely naked with a knife. The same goes for EMS and ambulance crews. EMS will not go into a violent scene before Officers get there and deem the scene safe. We need Officers to protect these EMS crews so they may tend to individuals in need. Police Officers are needed by these community organizations for their safety as they perform their duties.  I do NOT agree with the City Council to abolish police or the new department. However, I agree with increasing the police budget and would like to see more Officers receive more training. Officers should be required to have mandatory training one day out of the week and not 4 hours a year. That is the issue. Much more training. I urge the city council to invest in this training. Also, please listen to all of the options. This abolish the police is foolish."
"6/29/2020 5:06:01 PM",-25,"","","Though I do not currently live in Minneapolis, I grew up here and my parents still reside in SW Minneapolis. It has been heartbreaking to watch the previous month's events unfold. What happened to George Floyd was a crime and I am glad to see the officers being prosecuted. However, I have also been extremely disheartened to see what has happened in the aftermath of Floyd's death. The Minneapolis I have seen recently is not the Minneapolis I know and love. It saddens me to see the violence that has come out of this violent act. I have wanted to move back to Minneapolis at some point in my life. However, seeing the violent acts and the city's response to this all, has caused me to question whether I ever want to return to the city I grew up in. In a perfect world, we would not need a police force. In a perfect world, we would not have guns. In a perfect world, there would be no violence. However, we are only human so there is no perfect world. Yes, there are bad cops. What makes you think these ""peacekeepers"" will be any different? There will always be bad people. That does not inherently make the department bad. That kind of blanket opinion on a set of people is what got us into this mess in the first place. And yes, reforms can and should be made. There should be more emphasis on de-escalation techniques, there should be community policing, there should be communication across departments and state lines to ensure bad cops don't  get re-hired, there should be accountability, and there should be a re-evaluation of qualified immunity. However, there should NOT be a disbandment of the police force. Is it going to take a school shooting to realize there should be officers back in our schools? Is it going to take a rise in the murder rate to realize that having a police force may be important? God, I hope not. I think the idea of a peacekeeping force is a very utopian idea. But we are not a utopian society. I strongly believe that by and large, police keep us safe. Just like by and large, doctors keep us healthy. There are instances of murder, there are instances of malpractice, but we don;'t hate on the entire medical field. What happened to George Floyd was not an example of poor training, it was an example of a bad man. Bad people will still exist with a ""Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department"". In fact, bad people i.e. criminals will be allowed to thrive in the absence of a police force. I find it interesting when those who want to disband the police, still call the police when they need help, take the semi-truck on 35-W for example. If the city chooses to disband the police force, I hope that whatever replaces it will be successful. I hope that it will be the answer to racism. I want it to succeed because I love Minneapolis. I do not want to see Minneapolis become a dangerous city ridden with crime in the sudden absence of a police force.  However, we are only human and I am terrified for what will happen to Minneapolis with the disbanding of the police. Please do not let what happened in Uptown become the new normal because I fear it will. Disbanding the police does not lead to a sudden eradication of racism."

We also agree that we need some police reform to ensure there is no racism and ALL people are treated respectfully by the police officers. However, my family and I do NOT support defunding/dismantling the police departments. We want our police department to protect our safety. We need more police. We need police with better standards, and police with better ethics and better work habits. The goal is to create positive connections with residents and train to avoid incidents such as the one in Minneapolis that led to the killing of George Floyd. It includes efforts to diversify our police force and hire officers who speak the languages of minority residents. No one wants crooked cops exposed and uprooted from the system more than good cops do, and failing to stand up for the good cops is already causing problems. While imperfect, police officers are still heroes. They wake up every day ready to put their lives on the line to keep their friends and neighbors safe. Amid a sincere effort to address concerns over police brutality, we have unfairly disparaged the reputation of the entire police force, including the memory of good officers, like Grand Forks Police Officer Cody Holte, who have paid the ultimate price for the safety of their communities. The crime rate has increased drastically in Minneapolis since the Defund the Police movement started. We don't feel safe to travel to Minneapolis for food, entertainment, and other activities. We don't have the luxury like the three council members who receive private security. Instead of using Minneapolis Police Department, they chose to use private security services, which costs more $. It is such a hypocrisy for these council members to defund the police department while hiring private security to protect themselves. Commoners like me can't afford $4500 per day or per week or per month for private security. We need to be able to call 911 for safety and help. My friends who live in the Powderhorn neighborhood have been having trouble calling 911 because they can't get to them. The police can't go to help them with their calls for neighborhood shooting and violence.    We should not defund the police department. Instead, we need to increase support for the police department to fight crimes and protect the citizens. As we move forward, I urge you to seek ways to refine and support the men and women in uniform who serve our communities admirably. Thank you"

I am a homeowner and pay very significant taxes to own a home in Minneapolis. Unfortunately, I am not shocked that I have to comment on the insanity that would be ""defunding"" or ""dismantling"" the Minneapolis Police Department. Our current City Council has proven that they are unfit to serve the community that they have a responsibility to serve. Since George Floyd's murder, we have seen over 113 people shot in our city in the last 3 weeks. I believe this coincides directly with our City Council coming out days after George's murder and loudly posturing to the MOB about defunding the police department. Criminals heard that and immediately thought, ""NO     LAWS FOR ANYONE!"" ""WHOO HOO!"" Comments from Lisa Bender in difference to that are so tone deaf and devoid of reality, that instead of laughing at her idiocy, it has me genuinely frightened of how someone like her could be elected to the head of the City Council. Ok Lisa, crime just goes up in the summer. Sure. Her sound bites on CNN of ""checking my privilege"" if someone breaks into my home were also so morbidly obtuse, it left me speechless. And guess what...there are 12 other people just like her on the Council! I would like to ask a question. If the City Council has the power to dismantle the Police Department, like they say they are going to do. How do they not have the power to fire bad police officers? How do they not have the power to disband the police union, who allows bad police officers to keep their job? I know, I know...they said they have been trying to do that for years, but the union is just too tough. Bullshit. Overhaul the Police department. GET RID OF BAD COPS. Chief Aredondo seems like he is more than capable of leading good police officers to police our city, which we sorely need. If this is just political posturing to further another far radical left agenda, I'm not surprised. I hope this doesn't happen. I hope more residents like myself speak up and tell the council that we need cops in our streets. I hope. Can you imagine the businesses that will leave? The restaurants, the bars...they are not going to put up with lawlessness. Can you imagine the taxes that will increase? The insurance cost to live in a city without actual cops protecting us from bad actors? We already have the 5th highest tax burden of any state in the country! Careful what you ask for, you might just get it. My vote to dismantle the police department will be a resounding NO. My vote to dismantle the clown show that is our city council will be a resounding YES."
"6/29/2020 5:10:34 PM",13,"","","Please see attached pdf. Thanks  Dear Commissioners,   I am a resident and homeowner of Minneapolis for 20 years. I have lived in Uptown, Loring Park, Longfellow (homeowner X2), and currently in Powderhorn Park neighborhoods. My church is Grace Trinity Community Church in Uptown. My spouse's synagogue is Shir Tikvah in the Lake Harriet neighborhood. My spouse owns a small management business located in Downtown East Stadium area. We are very involved in civic organizations with clubs, city boards, and neighborhood associations. Our son went to Field School, South High School, and PEASE Academy in Dinky Town. I hold a Master's Degree in Public Administration from local Metropolitan State University.   I share this with you to demonstrate our deep knowledge of the community, its history, its people, its organizations, institutions, and its police practices. Also, demonstrating our commitment to this place we call home, built our life and plan to continue to serve to the indefinite future with hopefully buried here. On the subject of mortality, we are both in our mid-forties and see ourselves living here for another 40-50 years god willing.      My request is that you support the proposed Charter Amendment to eliminate the Police and replace it with the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. Furthermore, that you move this forward so that it can meet the November ballot deadlines.   I had a very illuminating discussion yesterday with your fellow Commissioner Lyall Schwarzkopf. The points raised for not supporting the amendment did not convince me that this was not needed after all.   There are many reasons for supporting the amendment and here are some of them:   1. Timeliness of the change is critical. The people of the city have been stewing for a long time with the way the police conduct their service. We have come to point of an irreparable relationship with the police after multiple mayors, police chiefs, and others promising reform and things done differently without seeing any recognizable change of behavior and practice.   2. The police service is poor, harsh, and not a tangible service to the community. People complain all the time of slow or no responses, inadequate preventative action, lack of trust to handle the situation correctly, and as we have so tragically seen negligent criminal behavior.   3. The current police are so entrenched that reforms do not alter their practice. This only leaves the community the option of starting over for public safety, security, service, and law enforcement.   4. People understand the union is the main obstacle but restarting with a new department will at least give a chance to restructure the contract terms. And it will allow an opportunity for a new hiring and selection process.   5. There is an immense appetite for this change represented by unanimous support of all democratically elected Council Ward members representing every corner of this city. The mayor does not appear to back the amendment but most likely he would be voted out for another term if he keeps this position. The one-two (Mayor and Chief) current structure of police management is not working as evidenced by the city citizens. The elected Council officials are representing their constituents overwhelming desire to see this change. America and Minnesota should honor the wishes of a fair and just outpouring of their citizens’ wishes for their self-governance. Appointed officials should not poise an undue obstacle to a reasonable demand of the people.   6. Let the public decide for themselves on the November ballot. This is a core tenet of our country and identifies us as a functioning democracy. If we do not have this option, then what have we become? What is the outlet of a people if their representatives move an issue forward in a civic fashion following the rules established but in the end are denied their voice be honored by an un-elected small group?   7. Trust the public (defined in this specific case as the residents/voters of Minneapolis' policy/government). People can decide their own destiny and form of government they wish to be used with their tax dollars for their response units. Government officials and departments are to be supported by and support the community. If the Commission chooses to circumvent this bedrock of society then what is the inevitable outcome?   8. Do people think it will be easy or not messy with the transition? Answer is no. We are all mature intelligent adults that understand the consequences of our decisions. We are taking on a monumental change because we see monumental dysfunction from the rank and file police of this city.      9. Why not wait to study the issue more? Because we have been waiting already too long. Because the people know the issues, recognize the perils, and understand better than anyone that does not live in this city or experience what the average city dweller experiences. The process will be long and difficult no matter what. Let's start the process now, this summer, and see what the results are on the November election.   10. Did people feel this way previously or did this spring up since the murder of George Floyd? People have been feeling this way for a very long time. Our patience is up. The social contract with police has been severed. People want a new department and way of doing things no matter the pain the change will surely create. It will be worth it. It is absolutely necessary. Moreover, there are not any other options since everything else has been pursued and failed."

But abolishing or defunding sounds like a terrible idea. I already feel unsafe in certain areas near my home, especially the last month or so with talk of abolishing the police going on. It seems like violent crime has skyrocketed. Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels that way. I dont feel comfortable putting my address on this form. Either way, I'll probably be moving out of Minneapolis within the next couple months. But as someone who's here now, and has been living here (North Minneapolis) for the past year. I do NOT SUPPORT this idea. Thank you."
"6/29/2020 5:13:08 PM",15,"","","Hello, In addition to maintaining an active, fully trained and fully staffed police department, we must also work in a reasonable manner toward social change. The two can happen simultaneously. We all know that most police officers are good officers and decent people. Unfortunately there are bad seeds interspersed in the department as well. Those bad officers need to be dealt with swiftly, however the good officers should not suffer for this. Most importantly the citizens of Minneapolis should not suffer the loss of the protection they need from police officers. An important way to improve the caliber of the police force is to provide more extensive training upon entering the police department, and regular training on an annual basis. This training should focus in part on ways to diffuse situations before they become violent. In addition, police chiefs must be supported when they identify and try to terminate officers who employ unnecessary and excessive force. We as citizens need police protection. Just as most officers are good officers, most citizens are good people. However, crime is on the rise in our beloved city, and the good people are not the ones committing those crimes.    It is very concerning that people will have to find ways of protecting themselves when they find themselves in danger. Social workers, “holistic” methods and public health measures will not stop people who choose to engage in violent crimes. Those options can be implemented and used alongside a better trained police force, and create a very effective way of both protecting citizens and creating much needed social change. Thank you"

How does this affect Chief Arradondo? How will Mayor Frey’s role change if this is voted through? Who actually answers when I call 911?

I do not support a disbanding of the police department or the proposed ""direction"" that the city council has put forward. As we try to tackle and deal with the issues of systemic racism in our city, it's important to also keep in mind that our city has been dealing with an increase in crime over the last several years. We have seen businesses, residents and visitors of this city expressing concern over their safety due to a lack of police presence and action.

Not only do I support the removal of the Police Department but I would like to raise my voice to support a new department that is staffed by community members, is focused on deescalation and never escalatory violence, is committed to transformative justice over carceral justice, does not further expand blanket surveillance of Minneapolis residents and has less than 10% of the budget that the police had. 90% or more of the police budget should be put into crime PREVENTION not crime REACTION. This means housing projects, mental health clinics, increasing our education budget and our transportation budget, free health care, community centers, art grants and business loans and community events to combat white supremacy and toxic masculinity.

Killers walk amongst us, and you want to take away the only thing that somewhat keeps them at bay. The idea that they are going away has caused crime to go up! Any program you think is going to ""talk it out"" with people that are killing, will fail. Ego's run the streets, not calm people that can be reasoned with! Stop letting people that don't have to worry about their kid getting hit by a car, or bullet; that don't even live in high crime areas say we need anything but more police.

Since it is clear that you have not allowed the police to act since the riots started - I don't foresee the police feeling as if they can ever do their jobs. And the bad actors are certainly aware of it. You tied the hands of the police. You emboldened the criminal element. I am not sure anything you do at this point is going to help Minneapolis.

I see first hand the results of violent crime in this city which appears to be much worse this summer than in previous years. While I do believe we have a significant and obvious problem in the MPLS police department when it comes to racial profiling, lack of police education/ training, and knee-jerk reactive brutality, as well as a culture of complacency, and while     I believe it needs to be addressed systematically and with immediacy, I in no way support a complete defunding Or removal of the police. We need enforcement of law that is equitable and safe and fair and just, and with better and more respectful de-escalation practices for non violent offenders, but we do need law enforcement nonetheless. If there is any way to responsibly reallocate dollars that would be spent on things like newer vehicles or office spaces (frills that I live without as a healthcare professional, I sit in a chair from literally 1980 and use a laptop from 2008) and instead place additional funding in the areas of social services and housing supports pertaining to or regarding the encampment and people experiencing homelessness, I am also strongly in support of this. However I am likewise very concerned about the gun violence and violent crime and car jacking assault sprees and trauma that we’ve been seeing come in to the hospital and around greater MPLS hospitals particularly in the last 30 days, and believe these types of crimes require active enforcement presence and more skilled intelligence efforts to solve and detain those responsible and to find justice for the families of those victims too, many of whom are black or people of color. I will add that I am now consistently concerned for the safety of our community fire and paramedic staff safety as a result of the actions of the police and the reputation that is placed upon others in uniform by association. It’s clear in the case of George Floyd that police need MAJOR refresher courses in CPR And first aid since any aid was neglected until paramedics showed up, but I also hope cops can assist in creating TRULY safe emergency scenes to assist our brave first responders and not further escalate situations in the community, Thank you for considering my comments.

"6/29/2020 5:32:29 PM",-18,"","","You people are F****** crazy. Did you do even any research if no police and what you are proposing would even make people safer? You dismantle the police and overtime you'll find that you'll end up with a police force with just a new name. You will end up with crime worse than Chicago and when that happens, it will be very difficult to come back from that. Knee jerk reactions are not what this city needs. Do your research based on data we have. You'll find there is no systemic racism! More police officers, well trained, and get rid of bad cops is where the answer is."

I’ve had my car broken into. I’ve been threatened. Obviously, MPD needs serious reform. But crime is already “up” in the city. How will you guarantee our safety? I think the proposed, non-LSO community interventions may help. But I’m not confident that reducing the police force will help. Even if non-LSO interventions work, they will probably take months and years to take effect. And they will likely never be adequate to quell the worst of violent crime. Please do not endanger our community by reducing the police force. At least get the money you need for non-LSO interventions from somewhere else, implement the programs concurrent to the MPD, and wait for the data to come in before making this immense decision."

"6/29/2020 5:36:38 PM",-6,"","","Removing the Police Department is not going to help the situation. 1. The real issues here are the laws and the constitution. You need to study them and notice how none of them are cultural sensitive hence they do not the rights of all people only some. These laws, especially the constitution of the united states, have been written by and for old white men. 2. To eliminate the Police department puts good police officers out of work. Every police officer is not bad. To punish all police officers is irresponsible on your part and shows that you all have no ability to work with people unless they are put into position under your authority. That is a privilege move. So, kudos to you. More good people out of work! 3. Kroll should be able to be released because he has demonstrated that he is ineffective and racist. The problem here is he is unioned like the Chauvin and the others. Get rid of the union process. Police should be ""at will"" just like other staff positions. 4. It is clear that the Mayor has proven to be ineffective, but then so has the City Council. Everything that you all do seems to be in a hurry-up fashion. Everyone knows that anything done too fast is not done well just like 2040 and these bike lanes. 5. So, you say you are not racist, then give Medaria Arradondo, a black man, a chance to overhaul this racist system that he inherited and did not create. If you cannot remove Bob Kroll you have no business eliminating the police force. Get rid of the bad and help the good. 6. If you get rid of   the Police Department what is your plan, to get all new people to do what differently? How do you handle shootings? Domestic abuse? Theft? Violence? What will be different? Your process is not for the people. This is about City Council.  The Police department clearly needs to be overhauled and reformed. No question, but, to eliminate them altogether is irresponsible on your part and an abuse of your power. Now there are death threats on the City Council and we are paying for your security. That is unacceptable. You should be protected by the police. That is their job. So now you want to eliminate them and spend more tax payer's money at a time when our city is financially strapped due to the Virus, the George Floyd incident, etc. That is criminal on your part.  Simply put, if the City Council cannot work with the Mayor to figure this out and work accurately on behalf of the good residents of Minneapolis, then we have no government and all of you are ineffective and you have failed the City of Minneapolis. All of you need to find new jobs. This is over your head!"
"6/29/2020 5:36:49 PM",14,"","","I understand why you think that removing the police department would be a good move..but I don’t think those the members on the council have thought this completely through.. The 2nd Amendment gives everyone the right to guns.. and to carry them.. Sending in counselors or safety officers will only work until a few of them are shot or killed.. then you will be looking for police officers to come in and help.. Now is the time to retrain and keep the good officers and recruit new ones.. All those young people out there that want to make a difference should step up and do the job.. Retraining also involves selecting better candidates.. Which means better psychological screening and evaluations.. It takes a special person to do this job of policing.. and we need them to step forward and change the look of the department..

"6/29/2020 5:37:17 PM",-28,"","","I am against this, as this could set a precedent for other communities within the state. We need the police to keep the peace, and to serve and protect those in need of medical attention and to keep crime down. Without their presence crime will go up. I for one will move out of Minnesota and spend my money in another state. I am not the only one that will leave. The economy here will fail and leave Minnesota with a huge deficit. I pay my taxes and the majority goes to law enforcement. I am happy with the way things are now, with the exception of the few bad apples and brutality. People are already running rampant and shootings have increased because of fewer police presence. If you want you son or daughter killed then that is on you. If mine gets hurt, raped or killed then please be warned a lawsuit will commence. The council is too young to understand the ramifications of having no police force. I spend alot of money in Mpls and see no reason to go there anymore. But if you allow the police dept to end then crime will infiltrate to the suburbs and I am sure a civil war will commence."

If you remove police and install a ""community force"" I and my family, friends, would never go there again. We will fly out of Fargo to Denver, shop Fargo or Denver, from now on. How anyone could think removing the police was a good idea is beyond reason. I'm also thinking this is just a way of letting Sharia law into our great nation. Our State is dead if this happens."
"6/29/2020 5:37:31 PM",7,"","","To propose ambiguously defunding and/or abolishing the MPD with no concrete plan, roadmap, defined terms, or at the very least engagement with broader community has emboldened criminals, put LEOs in greater risk, and caused a great deal of fear and distrust in Minneapolitans citywide. To be sure, dramatic top to bottom policing reform is in order. Perhaps start by eliminating the union and incentivizing living in the community. But capitalizing on the George Floyd tragedy for political gain is at best a deflection from the reality that a single party has dominated the city’s political landscape for decades and has done little to address the problem until it found itself in the worlds spotlight. I returned to MPLS after 5 years of nonprofit work overseas for my kids to grow up in a multicultural environment in the city we love. But our growing family is in need of a bigger home and I’m afraid we won’t be looking within the city limits. I don’t trust Minneapolis’ city leadership. Good luck."

I have seen the neighborhood stores, gas stations and the police precinct all burn down. Powderhorn Park has a tent city where people are being assaulted. I don't believe things will get better if we disband the police I think they will get much worse. People will move out, which is what I am thinking of doing. It's just too much. No one asked my neighbors or me how we feel about this before the council voted. Please do not let them do this. It won't work. Too much trauma because of all the violence.

"6/29/2020 5:39:40 PM",-58,"","","A government (local, state or federal) exist to make rules. If a government makes rules they then need someone to enforce the rules. What good is it to make rules with out enforcing them. By defunding the police who is going to enforce rules? Who will stop criminals and criminal behaviour? Who will investigate ANYTHING? (Murder, robbery, arson, child kidnapping, rape) How long will it take to investigate a crime? Who will make arrests? Who will protect the residents? Who will protect firefighters and ambulances? Who will protect business owners and workers who do not live in Minneapolis? At what point are you going to be responsible for the safety of the people in Minneapolis whether you live their or not. The Federal, State and City governments established the laws and you (Minneapolis City Council) have lost the battle on the ORDER. Instead of handling criminals like criminals you have opted to slap their hands. It is only once they have committed a “seriously violent” offence that you take action. It appears that you have already lost your police department. The ATF and FBI are investing the arson cases from the recent riots. I have not seen or heard of a single arrest for looting and rioting by the Minneapolis Police Department. Your Police Officers are afraid to do anything because if it is wrong in anybody’s eyes they will be in jail and the criminals will be set free. I truly do not understand why any business (Cub Foods, Target, O’Reilly, Napa) would rebuild or even restock in your city. These riots will happen again and again until the people accountable are held responsible. The looters DID NOT take what they needed to survive, THEY STOLE what they desired, in some cases they stole what they could never afford in the first place     (Here and other parts of the country). By defununding the police, you are telling every person on earth that you (Minneapolis City Council) do not care about the safety and well being of anyone who is in the city. You are listening to the mob and they are winning. The same mob want to erase portions of history that they deem unacceptable. These mobs are tearing down statues and destroying monuments. These mobs are forcing governments to change everything and you are obliging them as to not start another riot. In obliging them all of   you have forgotten the rest of   the citizens in the cities states, and across the country. These same mobs are tearing down monuments of people who ACTUALLY helped their cause but the mobs do not even understand the history behind them. It is truly sad.If this happens I want to be the first person to Congratulate you on letting the criminals run your city. You will have taken the first steps into turning Minneapolis into a 3rd world country. Your city streets will become war zones, there will be bloodshed and this will be your legacy. If you step back and look at the facts about what truly happened. Facts Every death by Police Officers (Anywhere) could have been avoided if the person being arrested would have complied with officers. Police Officers are not robots, they are human. They are doing a job that sucks a lot of the time but is also rewarding at other times. Police Officers are thrust into a position or situation with very little knowledge of the extenuating circumstances regarding the situation and then have to react accordingly without regards to their our life. They have to make split second decisions that protect the rest of the population knowing that they will be judged by the same population if they make the wrong decision. AND AGAIN, Every death by Police Officers (Anywhere) could have been avoided if the person being arrested would have complied with officers. At some point, some if not all responsibility needs to be placed on the actions of the offender not the reactions of an Officer.

"6/29/2020 5:41:18 PM",2,"","","Though I am not a resident of Minneapolis, I was for 8 years and have been living literally one block from the Minneapolis city line for the past 20. First, I have to say that calling for defunding the police when city council members have access to money to provide them security is 100% hypocritical.  I'd love to have my own security so that I wouldn't have to worry about someone breaking into my house (which has happened 3 times--once at my Minneapolis house, twice at my current house--both by Minneapolis residents). We've had two cars stolen and 3 bikes taken from a locked garage. Each time, the police were at my house almost immediately helping me and making me feel better. Three of the times the perpetrators were caught and paid restitution. I can only imagine how much bolder criminals will become when they know that no one will be looking for them. Maybe the city council members will share their personal security detail with me so these things don't happen again. I would like the council to be more transparent about the percentage of people who actually want to defund the police--not the vocal members, not the PC members of the council, but the community at large through an equal and easy process---not hidden in the middle of a website, but all Minneapolis residents could get a simple survey mailed to them to fill out and send back or directions to fill out online (much like the 2020 census). Get a feel for what the residents of the city want, not just people wreaking havoc on our beautiful city.   I would also like to know exactly what ""defunding"" means in this instance. Are my Robbinsdale police (paid by my taxes) going to be expected to cover for MPD because we're a close suburb? What are the plans to decrease the crime? We were doing great about 5 years ago and it's surging again (surprise, surprise). What is the plan? I have worked with families on the North Side coming on 26 years. In conversations with them, they don't want the police gone, they just want fairer treatment. They want to feel safe in their neighborhoods and most of them think the police are necessary for that. Has anyone on the city council actually gone out and spoken to people in the neighborhoods--not just the ones who have the time to protest? This is a hot button issue, no doubt, but the blood of the city will be on the hands of the council if they don't think this through."

I also wonder who will lead the policing effort. Who will be in charge of all the various efforts and the overall team?

I’m in support of a new form of public safety, and like many, am most curious about the timeline. I realize there are committees forming and research starting to take place over the next year, but I’m wondering about the vision for a smooth transition. Will the MPD exist after the charter amendment is passed? Will it exist in a smaller capacity? Or will it stay in tact as is while these other social and law enforcement programs are being built up? Also, in the long-term, I think it would quell some concerns to know that there would be some form of armed officers for VERY specific calls. Obviously, the crime-prevention programs would hopefully limit violent situations. I’m a member of LC Cunningham’s Slack Channel for neighborhood watch, and I found this solidarity and community engagement inspiring and promising. I do have concerns about citizens feeling the desire to arm themselves, as I’m a firm believer in gun control and keeping weapons of violence out of our neighborhoods. How does gun control legislation factor into this plan? I’m new to this idea, but I could see this beautiful vision as a change that may take decades, and I’m so looking forward to hearing more details about the timeline, and the transition.

The police I see there patrolling the tailgate lots and in the games are some of the finest officers I've ever met. Black, Asian, White, all of them are top notch and beyond friendly with all of our interactions. Getting rid of them is getting rid of one of your finest attributes of the city. My wife and I love to dine at the nice restaurants downtown, but haven't been in at least 3 years because of the crime. We had a class reunion down there about 3 years ago and I commented on how ""rough"" the area looked. Later that evening (I believe around 3am) someone was shot in the exact parking lot where we parked for the reunion. Until you add MORE FUNDING to the police department and get your crime in check, we will never be eating down there again, going to the fine arts down there again, or spending another second there again. We used to love Minneapolis and the surrounding areas including Uptown. We just can't go there any more until the City Council wakes up and realizes the problem they've created isn't the solution.

I used to visit Minneapolis all the time, going to sporting events, concerts, plays, dinner etc. I personally think your decision to defund the police is not looking at the real problem. We need the police to protect the citizens from all over who attend events. I am pretty sure I will never go downtown Minneapolis due to crime has already escalated even before this incident with George Floyd. If you defund the police what or who are you going to call when you really need the help when someone is holding a gun to a ladies pregnant stomach threating two lives. I do not think the social workers or group of people you form for this will have no idea on what to do.     There are a few bad LEO just like there are bad lawyers, Doctors, Financial Advisors, Accountants etc. Are we defunding those people no they just get reprimanded maybe fined or censored or disbarred. You need to look at all the professions when you think a few people who made a bad decision and will now be paying the price for it. I want you to know that I am a white person and if I came upon that scene I am pretty sure I would have tackled the officer and maybe dead because I am sure they would have filled me with bullets but I could have saved George's life it was a sacrifice I would have made. Instead of recording on my cell phone I would have tried to save a life not count the views or likes on my social media account. That is one problem with this world people focus on how many likes and views they get on a social media account. This was about a life that could have been saved if those people are recording this incident for the views and likes. In my opinion they should be charged for aiding and abetting as well. They did nothing to stop it. I would have trust I would have. I used to work in Transit and we need to stop giving people 10 or 12 chances when they screw up. Why do we do this? Because the Unions are too strong and dictate how things go.I am pretty sure you took money from them so think about that next time you accept a donation you are at fault as well for taking their money. You should be accountable as well. Wake up"

You can Not   be unarmed if dealing with criminals that are armed. True criminals should fear the police or they will feel they don’t have to follow the law. We all Know the real Answers are education and poverty and drug/alcohol Abuse. Along with mental health services.

Their will be an increase in residents confronting criminals on their own which creates another severe safety risk in its self. Also, who is going to do traffic control prevent speeding on city streets or driving under the influence? Only licensed police have the authority to make legal stops and arrests, you can’t change that at a city level and that is going to be a huge issue.

Communication and transparency by the Council have been practically absent during our current city crisis. This seems like a power grab by a City Council that so far has performed poorly in governing the city. We need serious reform of the police department and the Union needs to be reined in so that the police department can function as it should, free of racist cops. There are ways to achieve this short of this extreme proposal. I do not favor disbanding or defunding the police in favor of some unclear and vague utopian plan by our City Council. I have noted that our mayor opposes this plan, as do venerated past leaders including Walter Mondale. I hope that cooler heads will prevail and that the Council will get down to the serious work of learning what has worked elsewhere, how to rein in the Union, and how to work cooperatively with Mayor Frey, Police Chief Arradondo, Governor Walz and the Minnesota Legislature — and draft a comprehensive, transparent, thoughtful plan that will have community support."

People assume the new CSVPD may be ill equipped to handle physical crimes like murder, manslaughter, domestic violence, child abuse and rape.     The community think of police as emergency protection in the face of criminal activity like burglaries, gunshots, intruders. People want to know 911 calls will still carry an emergency response. I personally do not sanction a union that allows poor behavior and performance to be swept under a rug. I also do not support qualified immunity as it currently operates. I’d like to see crimes by police follow the same due process as private citizens. Doing otherwise suggests a preferential treatment to those in the department.

Allowing buildings & businesses to burn to the ground and abandoning the 3rd precinct neighborhood to let the community fend for itself for several nights was, to a lesser extent, also unacceptable. However, this desperately needed change can't be positioned or promoted as ""defunding"" since that will lead to more gun violence as people decide they need to arm themselves to stay safe and go right back to those nights of no sleep, trying to watch their neighborhood - but this time with people carrying guns & emboldened to feel like they're the law. That misperception will also lead to businesses leaving the city which will tank the tax base, employment & home values. We need to realistically keep a     police presence and not be ""Pollyanna"" thinking social workers will stop people from robbing, assaulting & vandalizing. Social services may eventually get someone to change, but it will take years. Desperate people aren't going to change overnight just because they have someone to talk to or a place to live. And whose to say more criminals won't come here if there's a perception that Minneapolis doesn't have a police presence? Be realistic, make much-needed changes within the department (start by getting rid of Kroll), stop racially profiling, treat the same crimes with the same punishment regardless of skin color, gender, physical ability or socio-economic status, stop the rampant use of deadly force within the department and actively recruit POC to be police officers.

This City Council has appeared to pander to the media and listen to only one group; not all constituents, which is what the job entails and for what my taxes pay. I believe that the Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and violence prevention should be something that is discussed with the community and voted on by the community before the City Council removes the Police Department as a Charter Department, Article VII and Article VIII. If you are planning to have year-long community engagement and input in this process, then why do we need to make this change now? The City Council does not need more power over this process, especially since they do not include the community they serve in the process. The recent acts of Council Members have made me lose trust in these city leaders. Based on how this situation has been handled, it appears the agenda is not about color of skin or equality, it is about the agendas and political pursuits of the City Council.

The terms ""policing leaders"", ""community policing"", and ""leaders"" are nomers describing the tasks and those enforcing them that were formally assigned to police, however it may be set up within a new system. Abolishing or defunding the police and moving to ""community-based policing"" is based on the assumption that my neighbors have my best interests in mind, and that assumption is simply not true. In such a liberal city, with such a lopsided city council, a council with a shortage of voices representing moderate and conservative members of the city, how can it be ensured that community ""policing leaders"", many likely to be liberal as they are the ones heartily backing this system change, are fairly treating those that do not have the same political affiliations? Since ""policing"" will now be community member to community member, can these ""leaders"" remain impartial since the interactions and implications of their decisions will become very personal? Can I assume that my neighbor will equally support/treat those they don't politically affiliate with/disagree with compared to those they politically affiliate with/agree with? How will the city council participate in the various pieces of this new system? With news of them wanting to have the Police Chief report to them, how can we maintain a system of checks and balances to avoid conflicts of interest and a council that has power to manage every piece of the city? Will everyone involved in ""community policing"" have to undergo psychological testing? Will they be required to know local, state, and federal law? Will community members that take over tasks formally handled by police be addressing situations that could potentially turn volatile? If so, will they be permitted to carry a weapon?

I have a daughter and two nieces that live and work in Minneapolis. I have MAJOR concerns over this proposal to remove the Police and replace it with a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department. Already we have seen a rise in crime as criminals have been emboldened with this ""defund the police"" and ""remove the police"" talk. Criminals were also emboldened when the Mayor gave the orders to abandon The 3rd Precinct Police Station. The Minneapolis Police do a great job most of the time. This incident with George Floyd is not the norm. Derek Chauvin has been charged and he will have his day in court and pay the penalty for what he did. Everyone agrees what he did was wrong. That does NOT mean the entire Police Department needs to go and be replaced. This radical talk by the City Council is a knee jerk reaction to a bad situation. The Department needs more training to guide officers in these kinds of situations, like how to deal with criminals that are drunk, high on meth, or other drugs like fentanyl. Officers need training on how to handle another officer, especially a senior officer when they see something wrong. Officers need training on how to become more a part of the community and less intimidating to the people they serve, especially minorities that think they are being targeted. Eliminating The Police will only keep people from visiting Minneapolis, working in Minneapolis, moving to Minneapolis, and investing in new businesses in Minneapolis. The riots have shown us that The Minneapolis Police needs more funding, not less. The talk of eliminating the Police has already motivated many people to stay away and I have read the reports of many businesses that will not be re- opening here. I also believe that talk of eliminating the Police is a big reason for the spike in crime we have seen over the last few weeks. Thank you for listening to my concerns. Please do not remove or replace the Police. The Minneapolis Police are needed and appreciated by everyone who lives, works, and visits the city, with the exception of one group and that group is the criminal element. Thank You"

It will either just create another police department with a different name and everyone will be just as angry as they are now, or a department for safety and violence prevention will have less resources for self defense and violent crime will sky rocket. Criminals are people of opportunity. To assume that getting rid of the police isn't going to create opportunities and cause the rate of violent crimes to go up is irresponsible and dangerous not only to the community but also to those working for the new proposed department. There's no question that police are not trained well in multiple areas. But eliminating the department entirely is skipping past a copious amounts of steps in the direction of alleviating the current problems with the MPD. More time and money needs to be allocated to properly train our police officers. Our officers need to be held accountable for their actions. No exceptions. We shouldn't be hearing about officers with numerous complaints filed against them having suffered no consequences. The city should take responsibility, dumping the MPD in the garbage is only going to create more problems."

We need a better trained, more diverse police department that includes specialists for responding to specific calls. The majority of the city council is very eager to disband the police but I do not trust that they have any sort of viable plan to do it.

If I am at an event in Minneapolis and I am assaulted by someone, who is going to help me, some random untrained community member? Or are they trained and still allowed to be armed and use the weapon (only if absolutely necessary)? Secondly, the problem absolutely is not the entire Police Department. It is a select group of people that just absolutely should not be police officers that is ruining it for the rest of the amazing and dedicated group of individuals. Fire those people that have multiple cases against them. Evaluate the entire staff and really see who should stay and who should go. Train the remaining group and have a consistent evaluation process to make sure that those officers are obeying those rules set in the trainings. Then, I think there would be a better department that can be trusted. If this so called ""Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department"" does that and makes this system better and does what I just described, then that would be good, keep the name Police Department then. If it literally allows crimes to happen because we are too afraid to have someone intervene then I am not for this. Keep what the police does with an evaluation process and this would be exactly what the community needs."

The police department is too integrated with our community and removing it would only open doors for criminal activity.    But I will say that the police union is a problem. When it comes to public service roles we should not promote people based on years of service, we should promote them based on service to the community. To many young cops are chased out of the force by long time union thugs who get paid to “show up and wear a uniform” I have a personal story of a close friend who is an officer in the 3rd. This is a man I trust with my life and the kind of caring loving person that should be working our streets. But instead he is stuck working the night shift, often doing foot patrols in and near recent homeless encampments. This man has never been so much as accused of being too aggressive yet he is “stuck” on night shift. No way to have a more active role due to the barbaric union tactics used by the police union.

The police union manages all of it, including work slowdowns and retention of bad cops, and it's ludicrous to leave them to monitor themselves. Doesn't happen in any other workplace. And if it's on the State of Minnesota to roll back statutes that prevent the city from regaining control of the police from the union, then start there - demand that the State roll back statutes empowering the Police Federation. You need to kick their feet out from under them and take back control! From there, and I can only speak for myself, the city would probably be served well by supplementing the current police structure with added dimensions of social service and other incident management strategies given that we endure ongoing SERIOUS livability issues, especially in North Minneapolis. We're overlooked - ALWAYS. However, this city now, more than maybe ever, needs a police force that is well controlled by the city and that STRICTLY enforces laws addressing livability more than it needs ""Community Based Safety"" programs that, until now, have utterly failed us. We've heard about them - we know they're there. And they're great news stories but nothing substantive. We're failed by city government repeatedly, but this proposal, on its face, is a face-slap and an insult to law-abiding taxpaying citizens of this city.

We all watched what happened when Mayor Frey told the 3rd Precinct to abandon the building and neighborhood. To think that a “Community of Safety and Violence Prevention” will be able to protect Minneapolis residents is, at best, naive; at worst, it is incompetence of the worst kind. Many of us are already planning to move out of the city, but the people most in danger are the ones without the ability to move, so we are hoping for a way to add a ballot measure to eliminate the City Council.

Who will be in charge of this department? Who will that person report to? How many members would this department have? It seems to allow for continued traditional police presence; what will the ratio of UNARMED peace officers to armed officers be? Removing an officer's ability to use deadly force in an instant would have made many, many Black people safer (Chauvin's cold-blooded murder of George Floyd notwithstanding). As a community resident I have never had a situation that required an armed police officer, yet every officer that I've ever interacted with had been armed. If real change is to be enacted, some of these specifics need to be included in the charter or else it will be more business as usual. I applaud your steps to take massive action here, and encourage you to get to the specifics quicker. Thank you"

"6/29/2020 6:12:51 PM",17,"","","I live in Minneapolis in the Kingfield neighborhood. Under ordinary circumstances, I work in downtown Minneapolis at Xcel Energy's headquarters, although I am presently working from home. I have lived in Minneapolis since 2014 and have worked in Minneapolis since 2011. I consider this city my home I and expect that I will continue to live and work here for the foreseeable future. As a citizen of Minneapolis, I have been extremely concerned with the recent misconduct we have seen from our police department, not only in the killing of George Floyd, but also in the mistreatment of peaceful protesters (and even the news media) in the days that followed. The police department, in theory, is supposed to provide safety for all citizens of Minneapolis. It seems, however, that the department as it presently exists falls dramatically short of this goal. There has been much discussion on what is needed to change this. Among other things, the City Council has recently proposed an amendment to the charter to address this issue. While no one approach is a panacea, I firmly believe this amendment and ballot question are a step in the right direction, and I support them as they are currently worded. The proposed amendment, generally, provides for three key changes to the charter: -Replacing the existing police department with a public safety and violence prevention department. While the new department would include a division of licensed peace officers as a component, it would also include other employees and approaches to public safety. -Removing the Mayor's ""complete power"" over the department, therefore meaning that power would be shared with the council. -Removing the minimum requirements regarding the number of employees in the department, therefore leaving such details to the judgment of the council.    I am supportive of all three of these changes. -First, and most importantly, the amendment allows for the existing department to be replaced with a holistic approach to public safety. There is a saying that ""When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."" Well, right now, all we have in our public safety toolbox is a hammer - a department of armed individuals with use of force training. Replacing the police department as it presently exists with a new, holistic approach will allow the city to finally have a full toolbox for public safety. -In addition, placing the division of licensed peace officers under the control of the larger department of public safety helps to ensure that there is robust civilian oversight, a critical component in reform. -Much like with any other aspect of our city's governance, control of the department in the amendment is divided between the executive and legislative branches of the city, as it should be, rather than giving ""complete power"" to the mayor. -Finally, I am supportive of removing the requirements concerning minimum numbers of employees for the department. This is far too detailed for such a fundamental document as the city charter. The council should be able to adapt the size and budget of the department as needed due to current conditions, being responsive to the needs and desires of the citizenry at the present moment. In addition, I would ask that the Charter Commission and the Council do all they they can to ""fast-track"" this process so the amendment can indeed be placed upon the ballot this November. Recent events have shown that the problems in the Minneapolis Police Department are deep and urgent. Fundamental change is needed as soon as possible. We cannot afford to put this off until November of 2021. I appreciate your consideration of my comments. I look forward to casting my vote on this critical issue facing Minneapolis this November."

"6/29/2020 6:15:44 PM",13,"","","As a Minneapolis resident I did not agree that defunding and removing the police department is appropriate. While I agree some changes need to be made to the police department including more frequent training of officers, a better vetting process and more accountability to unnessesary use of force, I do not agree with replacing police officers with people who are less capable of dealing with criminal situations. The country as a whole needs law and order and Minneapolis is no exception. As we have all sadly seen first hand, when there is no police presence crime and violence puts people and property at great risk. Just take a drive down Lake Street and you will see what happens when there are no police. It is my opinion that a lot of what is happening in our city is more of a people problem than a system problem. We need more programs to help ALL PEOPLE be better and live better. Keeping the people of Minneapolis safe is an important step in helping people do better. There is no room for bad police officers and we need to do better in identifying them and removing them so the good officers can do what they do best. Saying all police are bad is like saying all people are bad and we all know that is not true. I agree the residents and police department CAN work together to make everyone feel safe. Put more funds into more positive police and community interactions and better programs for people who may need help getting on a better path. I believe there are far better ways to make positive changes for everyone to feel safe than removing police officers. Let's make decisions based on the needs of all not on the emotions of some."

I also wonder if we really need a mayor since this is a clear power grab from the council. I think this needs to go back to the working group and submitted with more detail for 2021.

The Mayor and City Counsel have failed up to this point and now is time to have each and everyone of them removed from office.

The levels of shootings we are now experiencing in Mpls. is intolerable for a city of which I was once proud. Having three City Council members spending $4,500 daily for private security suggests that they too feel the need for protection.

In fact several have stated that they too will move out of the city if the police are defunded. I think Chief Arradondo is an excellent chief. I think he is more qualified to handle the departmental changes than any of you are. He is a black man, undoubtedly experienced racism and knows what it is really like to be a police officer. It’s easy for us to be arm chair officers because it’s safe and we don’t possess the courage needed. I certainly believe there are racist police officers but I don’t believe the majority of the Mpls department is racist. Obviously the media isn’t going to show all of the kind and peaceful instances of white officers engaging with people of color. Sadly it wouldn’t be newsworthy in a society addicted to sensationalism and tragedy. I think your efforts should be going into negotiations with the union to ensure that the police chief has the power to permanently terminate problem officers. In addition, the revolving door of “injustice” should also be addressed. Crime has been increasing in NE, SE(dinkytown) and North because criminals know that most will receive “stayed sentences”. This applies to criminals with lengthy records as well! Crime is free in Mpls so why stop?

This City Council has appeared to pander to the media and listen to only one group; not all constituents, which is what the job entails and for what my taxes pay. I believe their actions and planned actions are and will cause grave consequences to the businesses and safety of the residents of this city. I believe that the Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and  violence  prevention  should be something that is discussed with the community and voted on by the community before the City Council removes the Police Department as a Charter Department, Article VII and Article VIII. If you are planning to have year-long community engagement and input in this process, then why do we need to make this change now?  The City Council does not need more power over this process, especially since they do not include the community they serve in the process. Mr Cunningham has repeatedly ignored constituents input or requested feedback through polling that doesn’t allow for alternative opinions, to justify his policy decisions. The recent acts of Council Members have made me lose trust in these city leaders. Based on how this situation has been handled, it appears the agenda is not about color of skin or equality, it is about the agendas and political pursuits of the City Council. If past behavior is any sign of the future, then I will make my voice heard at the polls when the time comes.

How will your strategy be any better/different? 5) Exactly how many Peace Officers will you keep for the first year? The community deserves concrete numbers to understand how drastic of a change this will be, and proven statistics to show you can guarantee their safety if it’s a low number. 6) Are you actually interacting with minority community members and the MPD to get their feedback? Many people do not want to get rid of the department but are for more accountability measures. Also there’s sources that say the City Council doesn’t even go on their mandated MPD ride alongs so you’re not fully understanding how the officers interact with the community and ignorant to the amount of high risk calls they deal with."

Most of the council members have been on the council for more then a year and made no effort to reform the current community safety standards . This rushed amendment feels like an opportunistic power grab on the heels of a turbulent period following the murder of another black citizen by the police. I am all for reform and a new standard in policing but the upheaval and onslaught of violence following the councils photo op in the park announcing the intention to defund the police indicates that the city is not prepared to completely gut the current system and start over with a new one for which there is no plan . This is a rushed reactive response when the council should have been proactive long ago and started putting a plan in place . It’s wonderful that the city residents are paying for increased security for council members but most of us cannot afford private security detail . This is an amendment that may well come in the future but not in the current state the city is in . The council has not even addressed the concerns of citizens over the barrage of gun battles , car jackings and assaults that have taken place over the last few weeks . That alone shows the instability of the community and the vast ineptitude of the current council. This is something that should have been thought out, plotted and planned long ago over a period of months if not years to get the public safety measures right the first time . There may very well only be one chance to get it right and this rush to save face by the council is most likely not it. Any proposals for amendments should have detailed plans and platforms to correct the systemic racism    In the police department but there is no plan. Citizen groups cannot even agree on basic principles for a plan and this rush to push this amendment through is clearly an emotional hotbed and the lack of information and misinformation floating across the city is going to result in disaster .

I do not feel at all like I’ve had any kind of representation or voice in anything this current council has done. I feel they’ve divided and damaged the city.

This should be clarified in light of the chief's inaction on this front during the riots of 5/28-05/30/2020. There should also be consequences in the charter if the fire chief does not appear to take action even though the charter states the chief has the power to execute specific measures. For subsection 7.3, there is currently no indication of where funding will come from and what funding standards need to be maintained. At the least, a framework or formula for calculating funding minimums needs to be included in the charter. This will be especially critical in the event that mental health professionals (e.g. psychologists, social workers) are called to mental health emergencies. We have seen past examples of these reforms getting swept away due to budget cuts. A charter amendment mandating funding standards for this new department and highly specialized roles (those requiring a master's degree or greater education) needs to be included to ensure this new department does not suffer from abnormally high attrition or is wiped out altogether."

The police expect to go home from there jobs to there families just like anyone else, safe and sound. The members of the council, mayors office, parks and streets expect the same. Eliminating the police department is the same as eliminating the streets department because they are not filling potholes, or the parks department for skipping mowing the lawn.

It's insanity to think otherwise. How many mentally ill people are also dangerous? The tax payers pay the police to WIN. Don't like the police? Stop breaking the law Almost every example of people dying when they shouldn't have still started with them making a bad decision and usually them fighting the police. Well all bets are off in that case in my book. The police need to be treated with respect. When a demographic of the population treats them with abusiveness why would they expect lesser in return?

We need MORE GOOD officers to address these issues, not less. This is not a well-thought out plan and using a buzzwords like “holistic” and “public-health oriented” does not make it better. Hearing gunshots from the backyard, having restaurants blocks away with windows shot out is no way for a family to live (and we live on the very edge of the city), so I can only imagine the terror those that live closer to Lyndale, Penn, and Broadway feel.

Police should never be an ""us vs. them"" affair, and I believe the root of the problem exists in the culture. I can see how deeply the toxicity, racism, and encouragement of force runs in the department. ........ I've seen police make gestures of force for no reason in public spaces. They emit an aura of ""order"" in a way that suggests that they are not here for my safety, or the safety of my friends, or other racial communities. I am in full support of disbanding the Minneapolis Police Department, and would encourage doing so on opposition of attempts by police unions to uphold the status quo. We NEED a thorough rebuilding and reimagining of public safety. We need several tiers of individuals who are trained (thoroughly and completely, more than two years) to handle separate and specific scenarios, rather than a singular overworked force inflated with funding thats wasted on military surplus. We need a culture of co- operation, and public service, ...... with people of various racial backgrounds, along with people who live in the city and understand it's demographics and its communities, rather than an army of out-of  -city, out- of  -county officers with no desire to interact in a meaningful way, respective of these communities.

My family is still in the city, and with police presence, the crime has escalated significantly. If you think removing officers and putting a community policing system in place is going to improve this you are so incredibly wrong. There are so many citizens that rely of law enforcement to ensure their safety in the city of Minneapolis that if you remove them, these people will be left helpless. Reform is great, it is needed. Replacing police will create more dangerous situations for the law abiding citizens in the city. Decisions made up to this point on how to handle the unrest have been disappointing to say the least, and this adds to the immense disappointment. This city has been through enough.

You cannot send a social worker into the gang wars. We need BETTER TRAINED police. The current training program is inadequate. We need police who LIVE in Minneapolis and who take the time to know the people in the community. My favorite good cops example are the Bike Cops for Kids. These guys circulate on bikes and build relationships and TRUST with the kids and their parents. Get the cops walking a beat and building relationships to the people who live in the community. Oversight of the police is essential and demilitarize them. Most of all please extend their education and training. Get Kroll out of office! It is sickening that I live in a highly Democratic City and the Police were sitting at Trump rallies. A very sickening visual that the police/police union are non- representative of the people they serve and protect. Get the politics out of the police! Why should they be supporting ANY PARTY, much less a very racist, misogynistic party at that. If you abolish the police, you further be hurting every home owner cause of the crime is not controlled, there will be a major exodus from the city. Property values will tank when crime and shootings continue without a police force. We already pay horrendous property taxes, with frequently having double digit percentage increases. The growing senior segment of the city population is literally be taxed out of their homes. Your vision is unrealistic.

Some examples of this have already occurred with the amount of violence that has occurred over the last two weeks and would only continue. There will be a huge ripple effect on so many other things including the overall economy as businesses will not stand for putting their employees or staff in an unsafe position and pull out of Minneapolis. Residents will flock to the suburbs. If the goal is to have an unsafe and empty city then this is certainly a step in that direction. Is business everything? No. But our states largest city cannot be without a police force. This is highly concerning that the City Council actually thinks not having police is even remotely close to the right answer. I ask and challenge each of them to show any type of action plan. As an employee of downtown it already feels unsafe more than it should with a regular police presence.

The unfortunate death of George Floyd which sparked a Civil War like atmosphere in America has now snowballed into worldwide protests. All four officers involved have now been suspended, arrested and charged. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis after being released from Texas prison for aggravated robbery. He was under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine at the time of arrest. He went to jail for atleast 5 times and a look at George Floyd’s profile as per court documents reads like a career criminal involved in drug abuse, theft, criminal trespassing, aggravated robbery as well as entering a woman’s home and pointing a gun at her stomach while looking for drugs and money."

Any police force will have those that are not happy with it, it’s the nature of enforcement of rules. The plight of MPD lays as much on the city leaders as it does on the PD.

The Govenor set a curfew and didn't follow through with reprimands, fines or arrests of hundreds who blatantly and willfully ignored  it. Violence and destruction resulted and is still active today. Any protests that remain are aimed at harming and killing innocent people. Destruction of buildings, statues and businesses are out of control. And it makes me angry that these things are not being protected. Politicians are letting us down and people now see that we are not being protected.  911 call times are too long or nonexistent. It is not safe in our very own neighborhood's. Soon civilians will feel the need to arm themselves to protect life and property.

"6/29/2020 7:03:27 PM",-30,"","","First and foremost, I would normally go on to address the fallacious argument that the police or that America as a nation is systemically racists but I will refrain. Prima Facia, it just is not true. If you are wondering how I could continue with this argument, then I would refer you to Larry Elder. Due to the cascading effect of the availability heuristic, that police are bad, is now leading the potential division of the police department. This will have a more detrimental effect on the impoverished and low-economic status people of Minneapolis. By privatization of protection or lack thereof a regular police department, crime will inevitably and invariably increase. When there is a problem who is going to address it? Because I certainly know it will not be the politicians on this board. Moreover, if you try to appease a mob, it doesn't work. You cannot appease someone or a group of angry people who are emotionally driven with logic. It simply will not work.    Secondly, what Derek Chauvin did was wrong. Unequivocally. That is why he has been fired and tried for his crimes. That is what our justice system does. But to equate the American nation of Police and the Minneapolis department as being equal is the fallacy of composition and is also a hasty generalization. If you go to any police department you will find that they are predominately altruistic humans. They get paid terribly and do a job that puts a target on their back all for the betterment of their community. I will conclude with this, what you are about to do will lead to a crime spike in your communities all at the behest of a mob with insufficient evidence and fallacious arguments. Also, I will propose a solution. Provide more funding to the Police Department. This funding should be allocated for better officer training, incentivized higher pay but also higher educated individuals. Knowledge leads to the eradication of hatred and racism. If you don't want stupid mistakes to happen, hire smarter individuals. Also if the Officer had trained in Jui-Jitsu he would have been more adequate at restraining George Floyd and would have known that the restraint he was using would contribute to his insufficient oxygen."

I'm a Democrat and have been for years... I've never seen a council so out of touch with their constituents. Their ideas to bring in an untrained, uneducated person to run the MPD is useless...bring in someone who has no idea what should be done to retrain and restructure an essential service in the city and get ""ideas"" from their little meetings with out actually having Real Data behind these changes is beyond idiotic. I love this city, I do believe systemic racism has to be erradicated from our government systems...but take a step back from the rhetoric, do some real WORK and identify REAL SOLUTIONS! DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO CHANGE THE CITY'S CHARTER!"
"6/29/2020 7:09:44 PM",12,"","","NO!!! I do not support this change. This is irresponsible! Residents shall be able to expect certain BASIC requirements as afforded by law and history and to which our taxes support. Public Health & Public Safety. These are the basics! The changes to the name is playing game to ‘soften’ the name but provides no clear direction of the basic right originally afforded by the constitution. Public safety was and remains a basic tenant. This suggestion to change the authoritative decision making authority to the council, which previously was to the Mayor, weakens the clarity and direction, especially important when emergencies rise or political dialogue is stifled in decision. There is already an adequate checks and balances and this provision eliminates that. It is fair to expect that a department that requires emergency response, be at the direction of one, not a large contingent that needs to take action that will take time, be a culprit to political gridlock. It provides no definition of the level funding. The prior does. The suggested says ‘appropriate’. No indication that the funding is to be responsive to population or tax base or any other metric, just a subjective ‘appropriate’. The metric is there to intentionally establishes minimum expectation that residents can assume. It is not whimsy to politics, the political persuasion of the mayor orcouncilorayitgerthingthatwouldresiktin radical funding swings that can not address hiring or firing at extremes as could be anticipate by a 4 year change in governance. It removes the language that calls for officers to be sworn. We have a right to trained, accredited, and officers with common knowledge in LAW and are held to a common and certified standard across jurisdictions. The state offers this. We should expect this. The charter removes the written ability for the Mayor to bring in additional sworn resources, if necessary. Had we not had the Military Affairs step in, we would not have curbed the aggressive destruction and fires. We hope that this is not necessary in the future, but why would we eliminate the ability to enforce peace? To construct a charter change, so significant, without first even attempting to craft change, is irresponsible. There is nothing in the current charter that keeps us from hiring social workers. There is nothing that talks about negotiating union contracts. There is nothing that limits organizational change within the department. There is nothing on the charter that limits the training that these officers receive. If we want to add social workers, increase cultural training, and put provisions in place for a fair union that does not hold the city at mercy, those can all be achieved in the current charter. But the elimination of basic expectations of officer credentials and funding has forgotten that we have established government for for public health and public safety, and this sets the minimum expectation. If we want to change the charter, set a minimum expectation for the addition of social workers. Otherwise, work within the structure, training, union agreement and other frameworks to evolve the department to meet the needs of all residents."

I do feel some things have to change, but getting rid of the Police shows that the present City Council is incapable of wisdom In governing and they should all be replaced with people who are fair and who represent their constituents.  I have failed to see that in your rash decision making.

"6/29/2020 7:14:56 PM",-26,"","","Defunding the police has to be one of the worst ideas I have ever heard. Do you understand how many people only keep their violent impulses in check because of fear of punishment? With an even further decrease in the chance of being caught, these people will have no need to hold back any further. I don't understand why you want to turn this city into the Purge. More people die in car accidents than police related deaths; yes even Black people. Over indulging the false narrative that this is a high cause of death is just feeding a phobia and paranoia that is frankly, unfounded. Do the police kill people unfairly? Absolutely, and those situations need review and proper punishment if found necessary. Police have to accept to some point that there lives are in danger from their work and need to be less eager to shoot first. That is the burden of the duty they undertook. For this, they need to be compensated fairly and appreciated for the necessary and heavy task they have taken up. Still, they are responsible for the lives in their care when they arrest, and need to treat any complaints of medical emergency seriously. Letting the city burn was shameful, and shows what a hellscape our copfree future is gong to be like. People are not able to control their darker impulses on their own. No amount of counseling or hugging it out is going to change that. Some people don't want hugs, they just want the world to burn. You probably should try to set up some kind of strong mentorship program in the roughest neighborhoods to try and intercept elementary school children, particularly boys, before they get into the gang warfare system. Help them buy into society before they decide to burn it down. Be the village that raises the child, but we still need our guards to maintain order and security for the people who want to live peaceful lives. Security is one of the baseline needs in the hierarchy. You won't be able to worry about supporting other marginalized groups, like LBGTQ, when we are all sleeping in shifts to try and defend ourselves against the roving gangs of bandits who own this city unopposed. Also, vigilante groups are going to set up. Did you see what happened in CHAZ? There was a shooting from a white SUV, so CHAZ security set out a hit on all white SUVs. Two black teenagers happened to steal a neighbors car for a joyride that fit that description. CHAZ police gunned down the sixteen year old and brained the 14 year old with an icepick. There were no guns found in the car, the windows were rolled up, it looks like they probably weren't the shooters, so mob justice killed the wrong people. Another angry mob burned down a house they believed had kidnapped children in it in Milwaukee. They were mistaken again and the kids were found three miles away, but they did destroy the house of a woman who was away giving birth. Fortunately her two year old was with her brother, or that two year old would be another fair sacrifice to the greater good of mob rule. I wish I felt comfortable enough to include my full name, but my god, you've let these monsters run rampant and destroy the lives of anyone who so much disagrees with witchhunts, so I fear too much for the chaos in this society that you have already unleashed. I am looking into getting a gun so I can stand a chance in the upcoming turf wars and collapse of society.

Let it go to vote, and let the people decide."
"6/29/2020 7:22:38 PM",-8,"","","Ultimately, the police department and its chief and policies are under your purview. To suddenly start pointing fingers at the MPD and want to gut it is irresponsible and irrational. Yes, a murder occurred and the officers are being prosecuted as such. Defunding and dismantling the department without a solid replacement plan in place is ludicrous. Make the modifications, demand better training, break the union, lobby for legislation but all the while realize you need enforcement of laws. To request private security in the face of your decision is ironic. Also, the economic impact of such actions will be devastating. I'm sure corporate execs are mulling over potential relocation of businesses should the police department be altered. Then what will happen? Please don't fall victim to globalizing the issue when there are many good, caring officers trying to do a very difficult job."
"6/29/2020 7:22:53 PM",3,"","","The Minneapolis city council should absolutely not be given more power. We need the police to protect this city. I’m in favor of reforms to training, tactics, discipline procedures etc., not decreasing funding or having no funding at all! The council is not a sufficiently answerable body to the residents of Minneapolis and so should not be given the level of power they want over the police department."

I pay for parking, eat my breakfasts/lunches out and spend evenings at entertainment venues. I spend more than my fair share of money in Mpls. It has been on a steady decline the last 10 years. If police are abolished I will WFH permanently and likely never set foot in downtown again. The thugs are already too much to deal with. Your community service idea is stupid. The criminals are salivating. There have been more car jackings the last 1-2 weeks than I can remember in the last 10 years. The Mpls City Council is full of fools."

The police are essential first responders who deserve to be valued, deserve our respect, and deserve increased funding. Why don't you figure out what was really going on during the 9 MINUTES where an officer would rather be videotaped with his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck than any other course of action. This was not racism - it was criminal - and that is what needs to be addressed. We need more law and order. We do not need a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department."

"6/29/2020 7:24:14 PM",-10,"","","Thank you for allowing us to voice our opinions. I think this proposed amendment is a horrible idea. There is zero clarification about how the law enforcement portion will work. I have lived in Minneapolis for 3/4 of my life. My children attend the Minneapolis Public Schools. I love this city. That being said, if the Minneapolis Police Department is abolished, I will move, as will so many of the citizens of this city. I will not live in a city where the law is not upheld. As soon as the City Council announced what they were planning to do, crime sky rocketed. Our normally quiet Bancroft neighborhood is now filled with the sounds of gun shots and reports of crimes that don't normally exist here. The criminals have listened to the City Council. They know that the MPD's hands are tied, and they're giving us a taste of what the future of Minneapolis looks like. I cannot raise my children in this type of environment, and I know many more feel the same. If this passes, not only will you have a mass exodus of residents from the city, but your schools will once again be empty, the businesses in the community will leave for safer areas, unemployment will skyrocket beyond what it looks like because of Covid. Our once beautiful city will become the next Chicago or Detroit, and that makes me so sad. The mayor and  the  chief  are  working  towards  making  changes.  They've  already  begun.  Change  cannot happen overnight, especially when you're dealing with people, but it will happen if the City Council and the government would support the mayor and chief instead of going against them. More focus on this city needs to be put on reducing crime, especially violent crimes committed by our residents. We are hurting each other FAR MORE than police are hurting us. The facts support that if people would just take time to read the facts instead of listening to news headlines and politicians. Please, please, do not allow this amendment to go through. Thank you for listening."

I truly believe that by developing a more equitable society, crime rates will drop. Citizens could still call 911 with urgent needs, but there need also be a structure then to disseminate those calls to the appropriate dept. employees to handle. Right now, it is ridiculous to send police trained to respond to violence to take down burglary and robbery reports, deal with traffic problems, etc. ""Police"" responding to non-threatening situations do not need to bring guns along in order for them to serve citizens. And the police who are trained to respond to more challenging situations need to be trained in de-escalation and how to be anti-racist. It must be possible for their Chief to discipline and fire them just like the rest of us. And citizens deserve a valid and meaningful course of action they can follow to get some type of charge against officers who kill their relatives. Information in killings needs to be made transparent and open to citizens via some method. Ultimately, we may need more police, but not just a garden variety type trained to maim and kill. But with most trained to either provide services that lift the community out of     their problems, not just send them to jail for being poor &/or black, or to serve as a resource to guide citizens to other organizations that can help them. Oh, and we need to demilitarize the police over time. I believe the militarization of them that has taken place is a factor in why the purchase of guns by criminals and regular citizens has escalated. This is dangerous for everyone. Fewer guns overall will result in fewer killings. Thank you."

The situation at Powderhorn park is indicative of what a city with less police will look like. No thanks - there are plenty of parks, lakes, ice cream shops, museums, arts, and restaurants to fulfill our wants outside of Minneapolis. We will not support this with our tourism dollars.

This terrible crime needs to be tried in court and protections put in place so that it never happens again. When a person is disabled totally by a policeman, no abuse should EVER happen to that person, and that must be an absolute law followed by all police officers. No self respecting person should ever beat or abuse a person he/she has disabled with handcuffs. Penalties must be heavy to prevent this from EVER happening again. AND we must retrain that absolute rule into our mostly excellent police department, require body cams 24x7x365 for all concerned, and reopen and fund our mostly excellent Minneapolis department.

All of you have been ignoring or ignorant of the FACT that Eugenics ideology is the source of the inequality. That one type of person is better than all others. and the junk science that was created to support that delusion of grandeur . and that same junk science used to establish discriminatory policies and laws. Eugenics never went away ,  It was just rebranded, after the atrocities committed by hitler and nazis who were carrying out a Eugenics program called T4 program. that was perfected by killing disabled and feeble-minded before moving onto the jews. Hitler got the gassing Idea from US eugenics commission that Germany was a part of, but was later kicked out when Germany did not agree with US direction of nordic white being supreme ideal for human super race. . People with disabilities have it far worse than those who are black. even those who are black severely discriminate against people with disabilities. its so bad that people with disabilities was removed from the original civil rights law that blacks enjoy. But the source is defiantly Eugenics ideology, they are the ones that established that race was inferior to Nordic white. That feeble minded, women ageism all of it. I would highly recommend reading ""war against the weak"" It will give you better insight on where to start to amend the rift that Eugenics ideology created. Need to understand how we got to where we are now if we are ever going to become true equals, ALL of us. Not just black and white. So when I say all lives matter I am NOT using the political version regarding white and black or police and black. I am speaking that every single legal citizen of the USA is equal and thus need to be treated as equals and fairly. regardless of skin, clothing, wealth, health, age, sex, etc.    but if people are going to riot and resort to violence then they need to be held accountable. how many riots have been committed by people with disabilities regarding the massive wrongs and atrocities committed against us though history and is actively happening today?.   Exactly ZERO. we are still being killed,, murdered where the murderer is forgiven, denied the right to procreate, sterilized against our will, denied employment, denied right to vote, denied human rights, denied the right to self determination. If I remember the number of people with disabilities killed by police EXCEEDS the number of black people killed by police, list goes on and also includes ALL of the wrongs that blacks face. So what ever you do, DO NOT get caught up in solely trying to fix the white-black divide. Or you will never fix it, because until Eugenics ideology is completely eradicated , Eugenics will work its fingers into whatever program you replace the police with and corrupt it from the inside out again and if they can't do that , They will defund it or rule in court to mean something it doesn't to remove its effectiveness so the programs you put in place will have no effect because it won't be able to get anything done. So if you want to fix the relationship between black and white you need to see the relationships of those of us with disabilities. and repair it as a whole."

There is no question that this has caused our cities to be unsafe. What already was a volatile situation has been exacerbated by the words of the council. To say that it is white privilege that has people concerned about these changes is not true. There are many living in the community who do not want this. This is making all of us unsafe and giving criminals a green light. The next question asks if I am a resident of Minneapolis. I am not.

We should direct police at that which we truly need them for. This will set society *and* the police up for success in the future. I do not support abolition. I do not support defunding.

I am writing to express my concerns regarding the Minneapolis City Council’s proposed charter amendment ‘Establishing Community Safety & Violence Prevention Department’ (Legislative File 2020-00668). It is clear that our city is ready to make sweeping and much needed reforms to the Minneapolis Police Department. However, I do not believe that the proposed amendment is the platform from which this should be done. The City Council had promised a yearlong process with community engagement to develop a holistic approach to community safety. Yet, their work up until this point has occurred hastily, behind closed doors and resulted in a vague proposal. Established crime prevention groups and communities have not been given an opportunity to provide input. In good governance, it is imperative for stakeholders to feel heard. Beyond the lack of community engagement, I worry about the loss of accountability in our city and the deepening of bureaucracy. The current charter is designed in such a way to allow for checks-and- balances within policing as the Mayor has control over the establishment, maintenance, and command of the Minneapolis Police Department while the City Council controls the budget. If this amendment were to pass, it opens the door for abuses of power by the City Council and a system in which citizens voices go unheard through voting measures. Please consider rejecting this amendment. We as a community have not gotten enough information nor opportunities to share our thoughts regarding the prosed Community Safety & Violence Prevention Department to make an informed vote this November."

I own several affordable rentals in South Minneapolis. If this were to go through, I will give notice to all of my tenants, sell my houses and move. I cannot believe the poor leadership of this city. I personally do not know a single person that is in favor of this; just a small group of loud mouths. I can guarantee you many of us will leave the city if this happens.  The language is unacceptably vague and jargon laden leading to the inescapable conclusion corruption and political patronage will dominate it's implementation. There is no evidence replacing professional, sworn law enforcement officers (who are well trained) with political patronage and mob pressure tactics will improve security and safety. In fact, almost all evidence both contemporary and historical points to an opposite result.  Corruption in local government Because there are many   factors that can lead to corruption in local government it is hard to study corruption patterns empirically, but recently, improved research This article includes a list of references, related reading or external links, but its sourcesL ereamrna minore Thi  s Demographic factors needs additional citations for verification. Learn more strategies and information sources have made such studies better. There are several types of political corruption that occur in local government. Some are more common than others, and some are more prevalent to local governments than to larger segments of government. Local governments may be more susceptible to corruption because interactions between private individuals and officials happen at greater levels of intimacy and with more frequency at more decentralized levels. Forms of corruption Types pertaining to money like bribery, extortion, embezzlement, and graft are found in local government systems. Other forms of political corruption are nepotism and patronage systems. One historical example was the Black Horse Cavalry a group of New York state legislators accused of blackmailing corporations. Bribery is the offering of something which is most often money but can also be goods or services in order to gain an unfair advantage. Common advantages can be to sway a person's opinion, action, or decision, reduce amounts fees collected, speed up a government grants, or change outcomes of legal processes. Extortion is threatening or inflicting harm to a person, their reputation, or their property in order to unjustly obtain money, actions, services, or other goods from that person. Blackmail is a form of extortion. Embezzlement is the illegal taking or appropriation of money or property that has been entrusted to a person but is actually owned by another. In political terms this is called graft which is when a political office holder unlawfully uses public funds for personal purposes. Nepotism is the practice or inclination to favor a group or person who is a relative when giving promotions, jobs, raises, and other benefits to employees. This is often based on the concept of familism which is believing that a person must always respect and favor family in all situations including those pertaining to politics and business. This leads some political officials to give privileges and positions of authority to relatives based on relationships and regardless of their actual abilities. Patronage systems consist of the gr  anting favors, contracts, or appointments to positions by a local public office holder or candidate for a political office in return for political support. Many times patronage is used to gain support and votes in elections or in passing legislation. Patronage systems disregard the formal rules of a  local government and use personal instead of formalized channels to gain an advantage. Socioeconomic characteristics and the size of the population of people that make up a municipality can be encouraging factors for local government officials to engage in corrupt practices. Patterns of Demographic factors political corruption can be found in places that have a similar demographic make-up. Demographic factors that have been known to lead to or increase the likelihood of corruption in a local government system are religion, race, class, size of the municipality, local economic conditions, education, political culture, and gender. Some factors are interrelated or can lead to other factors which may cause more corruption. Size of a municipality Smaller municipalities may be more prone to experience corruption within their local ... government. These towns and villages nominate (or self-nominate) residents or officials to represent and run the local government, sometimes without oversight approval from higher levels of government. In a small community, personal opinions and relationships play a larger role in politics. Due to this, problems like nepotism or extortion can be prevalent. In addition, some local governments face another kind of disadvantage - lack of experience and professionalism from their representatives. It can be a challenge to attract qualified up and coming politicians to small towns. Another major issue in small municipalities lies with accountability - some have inadequate or insufficient structures for policing and prosecution of corrupt local officials, culminating in a difficult situation for those affected. Condition of the local economy Low economic development has been found to be an encouraging factor for political corruption. Economic practices like dependence on raw material industries and drug trades are characteristic of poorer cities and areas with increased ... This section possibly contains original research. Learn more amounts of corruption. Economic dependence on certain industries will also lead to less stable governments and less money available to fund governments. Fragile economies lead to increased levels of poverty and less opportunities to get out of poverty. Poverty is a known factor that encourages corruption in local governments. Places with failing economies and poverty sometimes get loans or start aid programs to support the local economy and the people, and public officials are often able to unlawfully take the money or goods for private gain. With less money available, local officials are more likely to get lower wages, which is seen as another factor that leads to corruption. Officials who get lower wages, which are not enough to provide for their necessities, will many times become corrupt and try something like embezzling money that may entrusted to them in the local treasury. Low wages can cause economic insecurity and encourage politicians to take advantage of current opportunities as public figures of authority. On the other hand, some researchers argue that the more money a local government has to spend, the more tendency it will have to do so inefficiently, which can lead to suspicions of corruption. Overall, poorer municipalities are more often perceived to have corrupt local governments than rich ones. Education Lower levels of education which are often caused by poverty are seen as a factor which encourages corrupt government practices. Those with less education are not as informed as to how the government works or what rights they have under the government. It is easier for corrupt officeholders to conceal corrupt activities from a poorly educated public. Uneducated citizens are less likely to be aware of corruption in local governments or how to ... stop it, and therefore, corruption is able to remain and spread. Without some kind of  political awareness, citizens will not know which candidates to elect that are honest or dishonest or other ways to prevent corruption from taking place in their local governments. This often leads municipalities to be continually governed by one or more corrupt local officials who use patronage or nepotistic practices to stay in office or keep influence in the government for long periods of time. When local political leaders are less educated, they will be less likely to find legitimate ways to make the municipality wellstructured, productive, and successful. Political culture of municipality Many local governments have an established political culture with certain expectations and practices that often determine what is seen as acceptable and not acceptable in local politics. In municipalities with an undeveloped or underdeveloped political culture, accountability and legitimacy is usually low and principles of ethics in government are not established. This can encourage corruption to take hold in the local government because citizens do not know what is considered corrupt, and local officials are not afraid to be corrupt ... because of the low accountability.In some places the local governments have been corrupt for so long that the citizens think that is how it is supposed to work because that is all they have been exposed to. Long periods of political instability will also lead to corruption in the government because people are unsure of how the government should operate, and thus do not know what practices are corrupt or how to stop them if they are corrupt.

I know reform is needed. Serious and elaborate reform. But police are members of our community, whether they believe it or not. I want police to reflect our community values. The murder of George Floy, Philando, Jamar and so so many others is a real tragedy. What happened to my neighborhood’s streets is different but was also, so, so wrong.

Clear house, make each new recruit go through proper training, every 90 days each member gets a psych evaluation to see if they remain fit for duty mentally and emotionally. 3 complaint strike notice for anything verbal. Any excessive use of force complaints with proper evidence, that officer is taken off duty until he completes proper training and courses to be reinstated. 2nd offense and they is permanently removed from the Precinct. The departments should be held as accountable as the officers they employ. The chiefs job should be just as replaceable as the bottom guys, if his job is threatened by the performance and problems from the lower guys, they might care a little more about how the officers conduct themselves instead of a half assed apology about the unacceptable behavior when they probably don’t even care in the end, only to protect their own image."

However, removing, dismantling, or defunding MPD is not the solution to the problem. We face violence and crime every day of our lives. The Community of Safety and Violence Prevention sounds like a utopia. Who is going to protect us when thieves enter our house? When they steal our cars? Who is going to stop the drug dealer in our community park? Who is going to protect my 13 year old daughter who is afraid to walk out in the summer night? Who is going to pursue a drunken driver? Are social workers and medical professionals trained to prevent violent crimes? We need policing and at the same time we need to reform it. Not abolish it. I would support a more balanced solution where MPD is involved in more violent crime prevention and social workers are involved in situations that with the right intervention are likely to deescalate. Finally, ""community policing"" is a horrible idea if it means that citizens of neighborhoods police their own neighborhoods.

Living in the city we felt like we should just assume at some point or another crime would come our way.

Ultimately, all that the city counsel will achieve is sowing more seeds of discourse between people while the Twin Cities loses investments, businesses, jobs, tax dollars, and quality of life to a vast data gathering mission to nowhere. This is not leadership. This is playing politics and it's dangerous. If the Minneapolis city counsel members are intent on diverting tax dollars from the MPD to use elsewhere, might I also suggest that they donate their excessive salaries to the cause?"

The horrific actions of one officer, who was told by a junior officer to stop, should not paint all of MPD with the same brush. There are loyal, dedicated officers on MPD who do the best job they can. Instead of defunding or disbanding MPD, the union should be abolished and there should be additional officers hired.. a lot of them, enough to allow officers to be proactive in the community not just coming to clean up after the crime is done. Community policing cannot be done when officers are constantly reactive. I would agree that officers should live in Minneapolis. I moved here about two years ago and I've never seen worse driving. It's because MPD has a traffic unit of 4... for the whole city! Ridiculous! I've had to call police 3 times in two years. The shortest ETA was 2.5 hours. That's indicative of a police department stretched to thin. Additionally, officers who only are able to reactively work don't create bonds with the area they work, there's no time for them to meet citizens until the citizen is a victim or an arrestee.. too late then.  My wife and I moved here planning on buying a house and living in Minneapolis for up to 20 years. We are both middle aged professionals. We are already looking to move out of Minneapolis, to a suburb, simply due to the rumors of disbanding the police department. It won't be worth the risk to stay.    In closing, I would like to reiterate my opinion that removing, defunding or disbanding the police department would be bad for citizens, bad for business, would cost the city money on property taxes and sales tax as well as revenue and only be good for crime."

Your citizens will not feel safe walking/biking/living in a place where law and order is not the cornerstone. Crime happens, so come up with realistic solutions instead of removing a police department and hoping that somehow will reduce crime. There needs to be a strong, well funded well trained and well staffed police department to protect city’s most vulnerable.    Additionally this will devastate the economy of this city. You think any small business will want to open in a city without a police department to respond to a burglary? You think any tourist wants to visit a town with spiking crime rates? You think any events will come to a place without a police department to ensure visitor security? Citizens will leave, your tax base will disappear. Business will leave, your economy will crumble. Visitor will avoid the area at all costs. If this plan is enacted then the fall of Minneapolis as a livable city will begin, a trend that will effect the entire Twin Cities area. Reform, train, finance and improve the Police Department, but to “remove” it entirely? NO. Bring actionable, realistic, adult solutions to the table. Not idealistic pipe dreams of a utopian future of peace without a police department. Minneapolis is hurting, and it should be.

Given the recent increase in violent crimes in Minneapolis (and even here in St. Paul) after the mere *suggestion* of dismantling police, I would not feel safe bringing my family to Minneapolis unless absolutely necessary and would not spend time outside of work in the city if it could be avoided, until a time when it was apparent that the city could reasonably assure safety. It is especially worrying to me how opportunistic crimes may unfold as more people return to work and universities after COVID and people are mixing more anonymously in greater numbers in the city with a general sense that no one is particularly watching. Beyond my concern for general safety given recent trends, I would suggest that the economic factors required for a successful public safety transition of the type the council proposes will not be attainable or sustainable if people are reluctant to enter the city for commerce and other purposes that generate revenue for the city. I am not sure how to direct the city to address these concerns, only that the city will need more than just the support of its own residents to succeed, and I (and I assume others) am not convinced that the nobility of this experiment exceeds the threat to public safety and economic stability in the city."
"6/29/2020 7:53:04 PM",15,"","","I strongly recommend that you follow closely to this excellent historical outline for civilian policing: The Peelian Principles laid out by Sir Robert Peel to define an ethical community police force. In this model of policing, police officers are regarded as citizens in uniform. They exercise their powers to police their fellow citizens with the implicit consent of those fellow citizens. ""Policing by consent"" indicates that the legitimacy of policing in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so. PLEASE do not destroy the Police from being able to respond to violent crime effectively, but use the Peelian method to approach citizen interaction as much as possible!"

I live in the Phillips neighborhood, and we have already experienced a higher number of shootings and crime in the past several weeks than prior to the riots. I was informed by my community relations officer that the police units responding to problem houses are no longer operating. This means that the drug trafficking and suspected prostitution on my block - which I and my neighbors were previously working with the police department to safely put an end to - is no longer being addressed. Violence is up in my neighborhood, and I no longer feel safe walking around. We need a complete overhaul of the police department. I 110% agree with that. Protocols need to be changed; the police union's involvement needs to be changed; officers need to be held accountable for complaints made against them. But we NEED a police department in this city. Gangs and drug lords are not going to change their behavior if the police force is removed; they will fill the gap that law enforcement leaves empty. I also find it incredibly ironic that the council members proposing to eliminate the police department have hired private security for themselves. Guess what? I can't afford private security. I pay taxes and expect law enforcement to respond when crimes happen. Please reconsider your amendment. Keep the police department, and focus your energy and budget on changing the protocols for training and accountability, and bringing other trained emergency and health responders alongside the police, rather than replacing the police department."

As a Public Safety officer on a college campus in the city, I see many crimes and abuses that take place regularly by unhealed, contemptuous citizens and illegal aliens within the city. I thank God I don't have to live within the city. Working there is often quite bad enough. The very idea of eliminating the police force and replacing it with some kind of ""community action and safety team"" is like sending a T-ball team of 7-year-olds to play against the Twins. It's crazy on its face, and soon there will be injuries and killings of these ""community safety"" members. Criminals don't respond to touchy-feely ""community safety"" personelle. They'll eat them for a snack. I've been in Public Safety as an officer for nearly 19 years, and even with my lengthy training and experience, I wouldn't want to go up against any hardened felon or be sent into a seriously dangerous domestic call, as I would be likely to be hurt or killed, and would I be of little effect in thwarting a crime in progress. THAT'S WHY WE CALL THE POLICE. We Public Safety Officers are trained to observe and report, and CALL THE POLICE when a real crime or dangerous situation is upon us. Anyone who thinks you can replace the police with a group of ""kind and understanding, gentle folks"" who will talk a criminal out of hiding, or diswade them from committing a crime with ""gentle words of wisdom,"" or stop a madman from killing his wife and then himself with ""open arms of understanding,"" that person is beyond madness. And believe me, Minneapolis will crumble to the destitute state of Detroit or worse in but a short time. No one will trust anyone, nor will want to live or work in Minneapolis. The economy will disappear. No student's parent will dare to send their child to study in a city that is essentially a lawless free-for-all. Our schools and colleges will soon become empty. Our businesses will be bankrupt. Our city will be in ruins. There's nothing wrong with the idea of improving the training of police officers to eliminate dangerous types of restraint techniques...

If fully implemented this will be devastating most of all to the poorest people in this city. I have known private citizens of color that have been shot and killed by other private citizens. To my knowledge virtually every police officer across the country has   condemned Derek Chauvin's actions. This could have been a unifying opportunity for all people of all races to come together against police brutality. Instead this horrific situation has led to a huge blow to police officer's ability to fight crime so much that the laws are no longer enforced. Abolishing the police is impossible. Camden NJ and other areas have not been able to eliminate all law enforcement and just rely on more county law enforcement than any city police they had before. A society without law enforcement is effectively no longer a society. Why create laws that are not enforced? Why follow laws that are not enforced? We have a case study on this in Minneapolis. There was a dictation recently that drug crimes would no longer be enforced (even though still illegal). Now it is common for my children and I to witness people shooting heroin or trespassing or stealing things in our neighborhood. Just 2 or 3 years ago this was not the case. Drug usage has multiplied many times over. How do you expect abolishing the police and not enforcing violent crimes with police will do the opposite? Crime has even increased dramatically in the short time since the looting, riots, and other lawlessness began. Imagine continuing this to the logical extreme. My friends, neighbors, and co- workers of color have ALL expressed deep concern that abolishing the police is a huge mistake."

I feel distinctly unsafe and angry when I see police cars pass by on the street. I am excited for this change.    I do like the amendment for its new methods for achieving the goal of a safe and just community in Minneapolis. My main reservation is that its language does not give me a specific impression of what the final administrative structure will be for the Department of Community Safety. In particular, I would like the peace officers to lack anything like the current police union. I would like transparency, accountability, and comprehensive training. I would like peace officers to have a college degree or similar education. I would like there to be no possibility for the culture of reflexive self- interested lying, ""no snitching,"" warrior training, and white supremacy to re-establish itself; along those lines, I would like criminal prosecutors to be socially and professionally separated from the peace officers themselves, as well as the coroners, dispatchers, and other associated professionals who seemed incentivized to corruptly lie, insinuate, and obfuscate in order to protect the officers who murdered George Floyd. I don't see any provisions in the Amendment that address those issues, although I understand that the City Charter is more of a constitution that a policy handbook or org chart. In summary, I like the goals and scope of the Amendment but I wanted to encourage progress outside of the Charter itself toward a better system that prioritizes community safety above all, instead of prioritizing the protection of officers from any and all consequences of their potential unfitness for the job.

Criminals have taken the call to end the police as a pass to increase violence and brazen acts throughout Minneapolis. I agree that reforms need to happen but an abolishment and or replacement of the police force in a city of our size is not feasible. The downtown core entertainment district had already seen a drastic decrease in visitor number pre Covid because of increased crime. I would hate to see the city continue on a path of self destruction. Many families, including my own, will choose to leave for safer environs if things continue on the path they are on.

"6/29/2020 8:18:13 PM",-6,"","","What happened to George Floyd was a terrible abuse of power and illustrates larger, systemic issues of police brutality, racism, and organizational dysfunction. Clearly, the force is in need of transformational change and major revisions to the union contracts the city  council  has  agreed  to,  in  the  past,  are  absolutely  necessary.  The  force  is  unnecessarily  militarized  which does very little to promote community and unity. However, defunding the police is an absolutely asinine idea. I commute into Minneapolis daily for work - downtown - and I actually believe the city should be given more officers, particularly in the wake of this horrific incident. The increase in crime is not going unnoticed and I deserve to feel save going to and from my place of employment. All people in Minneapolis have that right. Furthermore, we need for the role of police officers expand from law enforcers to service engagers. Yes, there will always been a need to enforce the law but there is also a large group of individuals in Minneapolis who are living with mental health and drug abuse issues who would greatly benefit from officers who can help people engage with different service providers to get the help needed. We can't encourage people to live on the street. Lastly, the police department has so much work to do to rebuild trust, particularly with children. This can't be understated and must be intentional, daily, and across the city."

"6/29/2020 8:18:46 PM",4,"","","I will never go downtown Minneapolis again based on the violence and disturbing choice to eliminate the police.

"6/29/2020 8:18:47 PM",-11,"","","Members of the Charter Commission, I am writing today to voice my concern regarding the recent proposal by the Minneapolis City Council to amend the city charter. As a resident of North Minneapolis, I cannot condone the plan the commission has put forth. The reason I cannot condone such action is that there seems to be no plan at all. I hear buzzwords like ""holistic"" and ""health & safety"", which may sound great in political ads, but they do little to address the true concerns of the community. Our citizens deserve more; we need to see the what, the where, the why and the how of their plan. What's next? This is not something that can be addressed on the fly. Unintended negative consequences are inevitable with such an approach. In fact, ever since the council announced their intentions, we are seeing a drastic uptick in violent crime and property damage in our neighborhoods (especially the Northside). One can easily assume the perpetrators are feeling emboldened by the weak messages from leadership. Take a look at the weekly crime maps published by the city, and you will see what we are experiencing. I am all for reforms that benefit the community, but when we fail to plan, we plan to fail."
"6/29/2020 8:19:01 PM",-5,"","","I strongly urge you to reconsider removing the police department. This is a short-sighted, knee-jerk decision you are making. I work in the utility and telecommunications industries and we have conferences in downtown Minneapolis. The industry groups I belong to are planning contingency plans if the police are removed. You are facing a massive deficit in revenue. That will balloon if you get rid of the police. Businesses will leave and folks who come to spend money in Minneapolis will come far less often."

Shouldn't they have mental health professionals ready to talk it out? I do agree that there is a need to reevaluate with certain responses. I do believe rogue cops should be held accountable, no different then the criminals in our midst but now are less and less prosecuted. This is accountability issue. That will have businesses and homeowners leaving. .... who supply the taxes for the budget.

"6/29/2020 8:27:30 PM",-16,"","","I believe there are racists on the police force. I believe police officers should be punished harshly for flagrant murder of citizens. I believe the police got what it deserved when the 3rd precinct was overrun and burned. If the police won’t hold itself accountable, and the law won’t return guilty verdicts against them, then this will be settled in the streets. That said, I want to keep a traditional police force and harshly punish those who execute unarmed men, especially unarmed black men. And I think the city council in voting hastily to “defund” the police without any further rhetorical strategy in place to explain this action, have handed Donald Trump the one life line he could’ve hoped for in the 2020 campaign. The “defund” topic is not only hopelessly idealistic. Because of its simplistic label, which which is hyper- efficiently misinterpreted, the idea of “defunding” is hostile to the actual fates of people of color by ceding essential political advantage to the most dangerous president in American history.

Not jumping on some delusional bandwagon. Or caving to the demands of a terroristic group. Or playing political games. These officers risk their lives every single day. I will never spend another dollar or go to your city again if this continues. It is ridiculous that this is the idea you run with. Rather than punishing the officers who were in the wrong. Be prepared to lose not only people who visit you city. But to have residents move away. Support those who support your city and do not follow those who hope to destroy it. Its unfathomable that this is even being considered."

Residents still want police on patrol and near by, last year we wanted MORE police and in my neighborhood in NE Minneapolis, there was going to be a fund raiser towards the end of May to help fund the police department in the 2nd precinct so we could get more patrol around our neighborhood. I am baffled how the city is paying over $63,000 for ""private security"" for about 3 of our council members??? This might sound like a good idea but what happens when someone pulls a gun on someone, or shoots someone, or robs someone or gets in an accident and leaves? The community of safety and violence prevention department will not work in this city and if it does get passed by the public, this city is going to be worse than Detroit and Chicago.

Really fully trained officers without regard to religion race or creed. I am certainly no fan of our mayor, but even he sees the utter folly in the Idea of abolishing the police. I am in agreement that the police union us an issue. They need to have their protectionist powers reduced. You could say the same with the Teachers union as well, but, I know you would never go there. Whats good for the goose is good for the gander!"
"6/29/2020 8:30:19 PM",-17,"","","Minneapolis Commissioners,  I am writing today to voice my concerns and opposition to the proposal to defund the Minneapolis Police Department. The City Council and other city officials have been so fast to blame the MPD for every issue going on in Minneapolis and it’s time they take a look within at themselves. As someone who lives and works in Minneapolis I am completely disgusted by the actions of the city officials and their constant finger pointing. Their actions have resulted in me having completely no faith in the competency of the City Council, especially Lisa Bender. Right now the City Council has more blood on their hands than the MPD due to their repeatedly urging residents to not contact the police and the backlash that residents fear if they do contact the police. I am so sick and tired of not being presented with the facts and with the City of Minneapolis being run by people more concerned about their “media tour”, getting attention for their radical ideas, and ignoring the resident’s needs. I am as heartbroken and angry about the murder of George Floyd as anyone else but now my heart is also being broken watching the city of Minneapolis get ruined by its officials.  Black lives matter and I stand united in supporting the Black Community and ensuring equality for all. However, I do not think defunding the police is the right action. The answer is in community reform, police reform, social reform, and it is not a one size fits all answer. Currently I know many neighbors who are getting ready to put their house on the market due to their mistrust of how Minneapolis is being run, my husband and I are considering moving, I have friends closing their Minneapolis businesses, my friends from the suburbs are nervous about coming to Minneapolis to visit us. Minneapolis is going downhill....fast! This is all due to the fact that they have a complete lack of trust in Lisa Bender and the City Council’s quick, non-thought out actions as well as them not feeling safe with the decreased police presence.  We speak of not racially profiling, not discriminating based on skin color, accepting all for who they are. Right now the actions and words I am seeing and hearing are more hate filled than ever and the community is being pulled further apart than ever. Last week a good family friend of ours who is a very kind compassionate man who happens to have retired from the MPD 13 years ago was downtown. While downtown he was hungry and knew of a black owned restaurant. He went into that restaurant to show his support and instead had the owner come over to his table berate him, and kick him out of his establishment b/c he was a former cop. Discrimination is still discrimination whether based on skin color or occupation.     Currently crime is up in the city, a 14 year old was raped in the Powderhorn Camp, businesses are being boarded up, and all we hear this is this is MPD’s fault. Please reconsider the proposals put forth by the City Council and instead work together with the MPD to better serve our city. I strongly urge Lisa Bender to step down, the city to step up, and the police to be taken along as partners. I am tired of not feeling safe in my own city and the unrest and radical actions need to stop.  Thank you for your attention to this matter."

"6/29/2020 8:32:56 PM",-23,"","","I think ridiculous number of shots fired reports, the random shooting in Uptown, and absolute destruction of Lake Street show that Minneapolis needs police. A reform plan should be put in place rather a complete removal of the MPD. The NAACP has a reasonable and realistic list of actions that could be taken. A 'Safety and Violence Prevention Department' isn't feasible. There's not going to be any violence prevention happening if we have social services trying to talk down a man beating his children. No suicide prevention task force is going to attempt to get a gun away from someone suicidal. A community patrol won't have any idea what to do about a gang shooting that ends up taking the lives of children who just happened to be in the wrong place. If people don't feel safe, they will leave, and with them will go all the tax dollars we could have used towards scholarships for black students or decreased home loan rates for black families or funding for schools in majority black neighborhoods or start up funds for prospective black business owners. A lot of businesses on Lake Street have already decided to leave and take those jobs with them. I'm obviously not the only resident of Minneapolis, but I have a feeling that, if put on the ballot, this ammendment would be voted down. The loudest voices don't speak for all of us."

Not having police protection readily available is a huge concern for mine and my family's safety.  The crime in the last few months has increased tremendously and it seems it is no longer in the late evening/early morning hours, times when I would have thought it was safe.

This charter amendment is the first step to the people of this city having a voice in the future of public safety. The amendment does not go far enough, in my opinion, in preventing law enforcement officials from participating in the creation of this new department of public safety.

For the city council to make a blanket decision that is so out of left field with what the public wants is not helpful and is harmful to the atmosphere in the city at the moment. It shows that your goal is to divide and not heal this city. It shows how out of touch you are with the public. My council representative won't even answer emails.

However, as evidenced by the group of you who promised to 'disband the police' and then the unanimous decision to forward this amendment with out a clear eyed vision of the future, all of the city council should be excluded from the adult table as this discussion continues.

I do not believe that the City Council has spent nearly enough time deliberating the merits of their plan and the possible potentially disastrous consequences. What is the rush?

I remember what happened during the ""community input"" phase of consideration of the Mpls 2040 Plan, and that all happened BEFORE the Council voted to approve the plan. I do not believe that community input will ever be meaningfully considered. Our city is at a tipping point whether they realize it or not. We have the best Police Chief ever, why not give him a chance to do the work he so clearly understands needs to be done?

As they say, when your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. If we diversify the available responses, we expand the possible solutions.

"6/29/2020 8:44:14 PM",5,"","","Removing the police is a worry some and potentially catastrophic idea. While I am sympathetic to the fears some are experiencing regarding the police this decision just does not affect the people of Minneapolis. While I do not live in Minneapolis my husband is a over-the-road truck driver and it is dangerous to not have police presents while making deliveries or even driving through Minneapolis. Robberies Highway jackings murder I fear for my husband safety as well as the safety of all truck drivers who have to pass through or deliver to Minneapolis without police. The idea that criminals would listen to reason is absurd. The fact of the matter is that robberies amongst truck drivers would go way up which is putting them in a dangerous position for just trying to do their jobs. Don't think that could happen look it up , there was a string of robberies at a government-owned rest stop that targeted truck drivers that was with police presence. This is just one of many scenarios that could happen to a poor truck driver on the road without police. As I stated earlier this decision would not just affect the people of Minneapolis it would affect a lot of people's lives and these truck drivers the ones delivering the goods so y'all can eat in Minneapolis are the same people who would be targeted and they have families and it is the responsibility of cities and states all across the country to ensure that everyone is safe and has a fair chance to make it home to their loved ones and removing the police does not grant that opportunity for anyone. And I can tell you as a non-resident of Minneapolis if there are no police I will never visit Minneapolis. And there are no promises no reassurance that would ever be told to me that would ever change my mind.If there were no police I just would not feel safe being a visitor. And I hope that the city takes a good long hard look at the consequences in the future and does what's really the best and smartest and safest thing to do, not what feels good now.

"6/29/2020 8:55:31 PM",-14,"","","Best solution is to outsource, either to St. Paul PD (preferred), or Hennepin County sheriff. Benefits: - Most Minneapolis cops will be rehired, but that's the point. They'll have to be rehired and bad apples may not make it.    - Toxic Police Federation goes away. - Huge liability to fund settlements (much, much higher than any other jurisdiction in Minnesota, including per capita) also goes away. The charter does not preclude this. Required ratio of 17 employees/10,000 residents would be maintained. Some elaboration in my blog, attached.  In the 1980s Minneapolis had a colorful, reform-minded police chief, Tony Bouza. The mayor he served under, Don Fraser, was as low-key and understated as Tony was flamboyant. They were equal, however, in their determination to bring about a much healthier relationship between the cops and the people in the communities they were there to serve.  There have been four mayors and six police chiefs since then, counting current chief Medaria Arradondo and current mayor Jacob Frey. They, too, are united in their determination to bring about a much healthier relationship between cops and community. Bouza and Fraser failed, all their successors failed, and Arradondo and Frey will fail. The Minneapolis Police Department is broken beyond repair. In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, every past study and blue-ribbon commission report is being brought out, dusted off, and examined for recommendations that, though ignored before, could, this time, fix things. Really, this time we mean it, we will hear. Just today a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council vowed to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department, but details as to how a large city could function without cops were notably missing.  Let’s do something radically different, but utterly practical. Let’s get the City of Minneapolis out of the police business, as the City Council majority would wish. Let’s do it, though, by outsourcing Minneapolis policing to the Hennepin County Sheriff, or perhaps even better, the St. Paul police department. Contracting with another law enforcement entity will bring three fast, and large, benefits.  First, to take on the task of policing a city of 400,000 people the Sheriff or St. Paul PD will need to hire a lot of Minneapolis cops. That’s the point and that’s the benefit. They will have to be hired. They will have to demonstrate their fitness to serve. Some, by their past record or current attitudes, will fail and be left behind.     Second, if Minneapolis no longer has its own police department, it also no longer has the toxic Minneapolis police union. Long headed by Trumper Bob Kroll, the union has stubbornly resisted every reform proposed by all those chiefs and mayors and city councils and study commissions. Post-George Floyd murder, at least four other unions have disavowed the police union. Solidarity Forever is not on the playlist of these other unions. Additionally, the city’s Park Board and School Board, the University of Minnesota, and three major arts organizations that hire security will now refuse to hire off-duty Minneapolis cops, though some would reconsider if Bob Kroll was gone.  Third, a huge expense goes away: the cost of settlements after cops do bad things. From 2007 through 2017 Minneapolis paid out almost $21 million in settlements. That was 35% of all payouts of all police jurisdictions in Minnesota for that period. Yet Minneapolis is only about 7% of the state’s population. Then, in 2019, the city was presented with a bill for another $20 million, as the cost of settling just one incident, the murder of Justine Damond. Some extrapolation of the figures through 2017 would suggest that, through 2019 Minneapolis’ cost of police settlements is more than half of the statewide total. This can be done. Minneapolis got out of the library business 12 years ago, merging its system into Hennepin County. And it is common for municipalities to contract with other cities or sheriffs for police coverage. Usually it’s a smaller city buying service from a bigger entity, but there’s no reason why a big city can’t buy service that will be better than what it has, probably less costly, and populated entirely with cops who serve rather than disdain the citizens."

I do believe the status quo is not acceptable but these proposed changes lack substance. I may very support amending the city charter, but I think it needs to be specific, well thought out, and be the result of community input, before the amendment is proposed (not the other way around). Here is what I see wrong with the proposed changes to the charter: 1) Vague and ambiguous language, which is basically useless as a constitutional foundation for public safety. Many different, and even contradictory, interpretations are possible, depending on the city council members or the mood at the time. Yes, this gives elected officials flexibility, but so would having no language about public safety. 2) I feel that the “weak” mayor system is already problematic for Minneapolis, so this proposal just makes the mayor position even weaker. Having a single elected official accountable for public safety seems critical to me, with that being the mayor, who I believe should appoint the head of public safety. Spreading accountability across the many elected city council members and the mayor would mean no one person would have to answer to Minneapolis citizens, via communications or elections. Additionally the head of public safety would have multiple bosses, who might have similar viewpoints on some things, but different and contradictory directions on others; this would lead to confusion, lack of clarity, lack of focus and mission, and “committee”-related ineffectiveness. I believe the roles of the city council in the role of public safety would be approving the mayor’s nominee for public safety director, as well as legislating any laws about public safety, and funding it, within the constraints of the charter.

There is no place for a city of this size to not have a police department. Previous examples of cities such as Camden, NJ that have been cited as disbanding their police department are not actually true examples. If you look at the details that city significantly reformed their department but never went a single day without police and actually increased the number of police officers in the     department. We have already seen a significant increase in crime within Minneapolis over the last several weeks and that is simply with a ""stand down"" approach that is being taken. If there truly were no police presence at all then crime would increase exponentially within the city as criminals have a field day with a lack of patrolling. The city council has provided no details on what this ""Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department"" would look like and how it would uphold the law without any police within its ranks. It is one thing to increase social workers presence at call involving the mentally ill etc but they will need backup and support from police officers in order to safely provide services. You cannot send people out to interact with an armed mentally ill person having a breakdown and think that there won't be severe consequences. What are citizens supposed to do if their house is being broken into in the middle of the night and have to call a community organization for help. This is completely irresponsible and ridiculous.

Had a citizen advisory board and also work with those that are in the community and know the people, ins and outs. More police more police more police. They are over worked and under appreciated.

They would bring us home if they caught us doing something we should not be doing. I was in Minnesota the night that the protects for George Floyd started. I was actually on Hiawatha Avenue driving threw my old ""hood."" Longfellow Park where my family coached and played, Roosevelt where my siblings and I graduated etc......

I think those events opened up a lot of white people’s eyes to the injustices black people have lived with for so long. I truly hope this is a changing point for MN, the US and the world. BLACK LIVES MATTER ! If we do continue having a police department, I think there should be more training on how to deal with mental illness. Or a staff of social workers out patrolling as well. But then I would worry about their safety with this gun violence. I find it confusing that the city is paying for private security for city council     members that voted to defund the department. I think the council hurt their own cause by allowing this and that it came across as contradictory to their message. Perhaps they also should have sought more public input before voting so quickly without any sort of plan. I also have great concern for the homeless camps in our parks. Let’s give these people their dignity back and make an investment in our future. We need more programs for these folks. I personally would be willing to pay more in taxes to ensure these people can get the help and services they need. The fact that the City has let this get so out of control speaks to their judgement and credibility. As of now I would say no to defunding the police because there is no plan. Everything is so vague.

In that case, a group was actually yelling at the train operator for not coming out and breaking it up. What happens when there is major violence or an active shooter? You are putting something forward with no thought or plan other then to say you did something. This is akin to closing all roads since cars are bad for the environment and instead implementing a electric drone system for all deliveries. The fact that you are hiring private security instead of implementing what you are proposing for yourselves shows that you do not care about the people who elected you and you are just doing this to say you did something. Instead of working with the people to make a better system, you are instead focusing on yourselves instead of the communities that have elected you. With such a guilty conscience from how you have behaved while in your elected roles, I do understand how they must think a lot of people are out to get you. I am sorry that instead of investing in resources that are available to everyone you are instead only doing what is best for yourselves without caring for the people in the communities     you are suppose to represent. You are saying that this won't work for you since you are so much more important, but for the rest of us, this new department and learning to defend ourselves will be enough.

Process and necessity to provide adequate opportunity for public comment There absolutely must be opportunity for written public comment that includes adequate time to prepare them with notice of such period   The public comment period ahead of this  July 1st meeting is a joke. 2 days! I first saw the public comment announced on one media outlet about 36 hours before purported cut off period for comments on June 30. Even if the July 1 meeting is only about the upcoming process, the public should have had adequate time to comment on that before the meeting.  For subsequent comments, there should be at least 10 business days for the public to prepare comments. The opportunity for such comments needs to be widely publicized in the mainstream media serving the Minneapolis market. An ad in the Strib should also be used. Certain state of MN public processes often include ads in multiple newspapers.  It would help if the Charter Commission would ask commenters to address some predefined questions. Of course, commenters would be allowed to address any other topic too.  The process for verbal comments at a public meeting should assure that comments from many parties can be heard. Time allotted to an individual commenter should be short, say 3 minutes maximum so a few do not monopolize the dialog. If this requires more than one meeting to accommodate many verbal comments, multiple meetings should be held.    2. Substance of the present draft amendment For this potential major change, the draft amendment lacks sufficient specific information.  Additionally, there were not previous, formally and appropriately noticed public meetings for community stakeholders to find out more about the amendment or offer feedback.     We are very concerned about the latitude left by the open ended phrase “The Council may maintain a division of law enforcement services, composed of licensed peace officers...” in the draft amendment.  The use of “may” is  not a minor point. In an amendment for a public vote there needs to be more specifics about the implications of doing or not doing that so that voters  know what they are voting on and do not have to parse apart and guess on the meaning and implications of “may”.     The draft motion would not provide sufficient accountability, while increasing bureaucracy."
"6/29/2020 9:98:37 PM",-6,"","","I strongly oppose the charter amendment proposed by the City Council. One key problem I have, besides the sheer stupidity of such an idea, is that there is no mention as to who is responsible for the crime, and why. The police are reacting to a crime problem on the streets, they are not the cause. If we want to reduce crime we must start with the reasons that people become criminals. Strong, safe cities start with strong, stable family bonds and shared cultural beliefs that uplift and benefit individuals and families. There is much more to be said, of course, but it's intellectually dishonest to not acknowledge the underlying factors.    I support something like an outreach component to public safety that works in addition to the police, but in no way do I support defunding or removing the police. Defunding the police will create a myriad of problems for which the whole of our state will pay. People already feel unsafe when they see that the mayor allowed the 3rd Pct. to be overrun and burned to the ground, and rioting go unchecked. There has been nothing concrete from the Council about what this proposed CSVPD would do, exactly. There is no reason the average citizen should believe the City Council has any idea how replacing the police department would work. They are not experts in this field. The average Council member received scant votes compared to the populations of their respective wards and should not feel emboldened by the rabid voices of activists versus the silent majority who rarely interact with local politics in any meaningful way. Please do not do this. You are courting disaster."

However, processes and policies with regard to the hiring, training and promotion of police officers needs to change. As a Dutch citizen living in Minneapolis for nearly 20 years, I am astounded by how policing is conducted here compared to the Netherlands. Policing is a public need and it is HOW policing is conducted that should be the issue at hand. This is where change must occur. For starters, officers ought to be residents of the City of Minneapolis. That they live in the suburbs and police in the city is part of the problem. They must demonstrate a commitment to community, they can be rated on the community relationships that they build, shift away from a militant policing model. ....... there are so many changes that are needed that defunding the police is a weak way out from getting to the core of the issues.

This will not in any way prevent violence and this agency will have to find themselves having to use guns and tasers. Instead of dismantling the police force basing on emotions, just clean out the bad egg officers and train them better. Just restart the entire department.  06/29/20 9:20 PM  I am in support of the notion to restructure the police department; however, I think we should have a department responsible for protecting and preserving public safety, and community engagement for crime prevention and collaborative relations. I understand the need to reform the police department but we need to reform the City's prosecution office and the regulatory services department because they also need accountability and oversight for discrimination against community of color and the indigenous people.

This City Council has appeared to pander to the media and listen to only one group; not all constituents, which is what the job entails and for what my taxes pay. I believe that the Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and violence prevention should be something that is discussed with the community and voted on by the community before the City Council removes the Police Department as a Charter Department, Article VII and Article VIII. If you are planning to have year-long community engagement and input in this process, then why do we need to make this change now? The City Council does not need more power over this process, especially since they do not include the community they serve in the process. The recent acts of Council Members have made me lose trust in these city leaders. Based on how this situation has been handled, it appears the agenda is not about color of skin or equality, it is about the agendas and political pursuits of the City Council. If past behavior is any sign of the future, then I will make my voice heard at the polls when the time comes.    I believe the City Council’s initiative to defund/dismantle the police has caused irreparable damage to this city. Their complete and utter disregard for the entire Minneapolis Police Department has sent a terrible message to our communities. It tells the criminals they are on their side because they don’t like the police either! We have all seen the significant rise in crime in the last month and little accountability on anyone’s part! Need I remind all of you, the primary purpose of government is to establish laws, maintain order and provide security, protect citizens from external threats, and promote the general welfare by providing public services.

"6/29/2020 9:22:40 PM",-18,"","","The amendment to Articles VII and VIII of the City Charter raises the following questions, creating a vague amendment that could be interpreted differently than the original intent in future generations of city council members. It is in the best interest of the citizens of the City of Minneapolis to be crystal clear in the City Charter should the city council insist on pursuing this path. In (a) Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention, the proposed amendment is unclear. What does it mean to “adequately fund”? Who determines what “adequate” means? What does it mean to “maintain”? And what does it mean to “consistently engage”? In the current City Charter, for example, there is s specific information about how many officers (both referred to as “police” and “peace” officers) are employed in relation to how many residents are living in Minneapolis (currently at 0.0017). The current City Charter also specifies how much property tax is collected to pay for these employees. The proposed amendment is too vague in terms of funding the proposed Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention.    In (b) Division of Law Enforcement Services, the proposed amendment states that the council MAY maintain a division of law enforcement services composed of licensed peace officers. The use of the word MAY implies that the city council is under no obligation to maintain a division of law enforcement services. Therefore, I request that the word MAY is changed to WILL. In (b)(1), the proposed amendment states that a director of the division of law enforcement services will be appointed. Again, this is vague. What qualifications should the director have? Any director of the division of law enforcement services should have law enforcement training and experience comparable to or surpassing any employed peace officer. Should the city council wish to create a Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention, they should maintain a police department with a police chief while simultaneously appointing a Director of Community Safety and Violence Prevention who works ALONG SIDE the police chief in matters of the safety of Minneapolis residents. I would like to point out that the words “police” officer and “peace” officer are used in the original City Charter. These two terms should be clarified regardless as it is assumed they are one and the same. Or are they different? In Article VIII, 8.4, the proposed amendment REMOVES the 30 day vacancy period for a police chief, thus extending it for 90 days. This means any peace officers under the new City Charter could be without management, a boss, or oversight for 3 months. This is unacceptable for any police force, peace officer group, or any other entity needed to keep a city safe. We have seen in the last 30 days alone the amount of crime (i.e., 137 robberies, 337 aggravated assaults, 74 domestic aggravated assaults, 10 homicides, and 39 rapes) as a result of lack of leadership in Minneapolis. I request that the Charter Commission deny this change.  Should the council members wish to further amend the following change: replace “police chief” with “Director of the Division of Law Enforcement Services” for consistency throughout the charter language but keep the vacancy period at 30 days. I also request clarification on 7.4 - Fire, section 3(b) - what are “fire police”? And why does the proposal suggest removing this part of 7.4.? I urge the Charter Commission to REJECT the passage of ordinance proposing amendments to the City Charter in the current form. Our safety is too important for a vague, hastily written proposal that has not been thought out carefully by the city council in an effort to meet the Charter Commission’s deadline for changes."

"6/29/2020 9:25:15 PM",-19,"","","I am not in favor of the amendment to the City Charter which removes the Police Department and replaces it with a Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department. I am in favor of an ADDENDUM to the City Charter which adds a Community of Safety and Violence Prevention team. The current amendment would create too much bureaucracy, has no accountability for the council, does not incorporate a testing method and completely discounts the necessity of an armed security presence in certain situations. My comments are as follows: 1) The mayor should be in charge of the Police Department and the City Council may appoint members of a Safety and Violence Prevention Department that is required to collaborate with the Police Department. The current proposal would create an inefficient and ineffective decision-making process. It would be extremely cumbersome to make quick decisions on community safety if they all must be vetted by 13 different people. 13 people, I might add, that have substantially less experience in public safety than the Chief of Police. 2) The council should be held to a higher standard. If they are to be the body that oversees community safety then they should be required to complete up to 30 hours of continuing education each year. This education should include, certifications in criminology, addiction and behavioral science, police ride- alongs, accompanying police foot patrols and importantly overnight stays in low-income housing for 2 nights each year. 3) Finally, whatever amendment that is ultimately proposed MUST allow for a test-run of changes the council would like to implement before it is added to the ballot. The testing period should be no less than 3 months. The test should be run in wards of the city with high and low crime rates, with a statistically relevant population size. The testing period should specify measurable key performance indicators for  the experiment such as reduction in violent crimes, reduction in property crime, reduction in drug crimes and overdoses, # of people starting rehab or being rehoused, reduction in arrests and reduction in weapon use. If the test fails, then this should not be added to the ballot."

I used to see police patrolling the neighborhood frequently. There used to be less crime with their presence. Now I hardly see any patrols and violent crime is skyrocketing.

This lead to a hostile work environment for the police and without proper training became a demoralized unit.

Ever since the city council came up with this idea a lot of these people think they have a ""free for all"" to shot at other people and steal and figure they will get away with it because the city council is not supportive of the police department.

I am afraid to see what is next. I have been to Haiti twice, we lived with the Missionaries of Charity.

"6/29/2020 9:45:37 PM",-6,"","","First, let me recognize that the reason we are having this discussion is because George Floyd was murdered by a MPD officer a little over a month ago. It was tragic and 99.9% of the world agrees that this tragedy was wrong and could have easily been avoided. On to the proposed future; the Transforming Community Safety Resolution states that ""police use-of  - force is among the leading causes of death for young men of color."" The Star Tribune reported on 5/31/2020 that the City of Minneapolis has had 10 police involved deaths from 2011-2020. Six involved black males. Therefore, 0.6 black males per year have been killed by the MPD per year over the last ten years. The population of black males in Minneapolis is approximately 38,000 (wikipedia). Therefore, 0.00016% of black males of Minneapolis die each year by force of the MPD. It is an extremely bold statement to lead a resolution to remove our entire police department with a fact of 0.00016% black males per year in Minneapolis are killed by policy officers. That percentage of 0.00016% is too high. However, removal of an entire police force is an extreme measure for this statistic. Solution to consider: ADD funding to the police department to allow officers to spend less time on the street and more time in continuing education and community involvement projects. (ie. 75% of hours on the street and 25% education/community). Police officers work in highly intense and highly charged environments. More opportunities for officers to wear their uniforms involving uplifting community activities and bettering themselves professionally is beneficial for us all."

"6/29/2020 9:47:30 PM",-7,"","","I believe that the idea of taking funds away from police departments doesn't address the issue at hand. The issue is there is a lack of trust between police and minority communities. Simply moving the funds from one department to another does not remove that distrust. I also think the idea of delegating tasks that require less force to other agencies should be researched but it also risks further distancing and alienating police departments and other law enforcement from these communities. In which I mean it leaves only the more violent and less humanizing duties to law enforcement.    I also think that any suggestion to simply remove or dismantle law enforcement without and immediate and equal agency is foolish and short sided. Also the naming and framing is important as well, such as nobody is in agreement to what ""defund"" the police really means and it could lead to confusion among supporters and detractors."

"6/29/2020 9:113:44 PM",-29,"","","The City Council's recent declaration to defund and or dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department is of concern for two reasons. 1. The announcement was given without CONCRETE PLANS as to what this means and how it will be implemented, adding to Citizen concern for the future of private and public safety in Minneapolis. Citizens are currently dealing with an unseen deadly virus that has caused high unemployment and loss of income, are reeling from witnessing uncontrolled rioting, are navigating loss of local shopping/pharmaceutical venues, and are now expected to deal with an upheaval to public and private safety, possibly placing citizen safety in further jeopardy. Proposals for radical change should not be given in haste without solid plans for making the change. For example, it is said that social workers will answer 911 domestic violence calls. Such calls are considered high risk police calls, as perpetrators often in possession of weapons, with higher rate of police mortality. Does disarming police in a society that allows citizens to possess weapons make sense? Does sending unarmed social workers to calls where weapons may be in possession make sense? Will social workers have emergency vehicles to respond to domestic violence in progress? Will social workers be on call 24/7, 7 days/week? Will social workers receive training in self-protection? Will social workers pay for liability insurance? Will social workers be able to apprehend, if necessary? Who will apprehend someone who breaks the law in this type of call? Sending a social worker does not guarantee a peaceful outcome to domestic violence or that a crime has not been or will not be committed. Folk wisdom evolves over time from hard learned experience, as in ""Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater."" It may be murky water, but there’s a baby in there that needs fishing out. Our police department needs to be fished out of murky water with commitment, investigation and support from those in position to make this happen.    2. Curiously, the City Council's stand on police reform appears to overlook the most valuable resource on maintaining safety, law and order in the city of Minneapolis, the police officers themselves! All members of   the Minneapolis Police Force should be interviewed with the opportunity to share ideas for improvement BEFORE radical changes are made. Who are any of us to think we alone have all the answers with no need to hear from those who have served us day and night, every day of the year, whenever we have called upon them. The Council would be remiss to bypass input from police officers BEFORE radical changes are made. In closing, I will vote against revisions to the Charter based on the City Council's decision to issue knee jerk policy change regarding safety of Minneapolis citizens without ANY CONSULTATION WITH THOSE CITIZENS OR THE OFFICERS OF THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT. The Council has displayed an ARROGANT DISREGARD for citizens of all colors who in a civilized society somehow find it within themselves to NOT BURN DOWN PROPERTY, STOP TRAFFIC ON FREEWAYS, DISOBEY CURFEWS, OR IN ANY WAY ENDANGER LIVES OF OTHERS in order to get their concerns heard. The Council's disregard panders to and promotes violence of expression, which should not be rewarded in any way in a civilized society."

We will, unfortunately, have to stop all of these activities if the Minneapolis Police force is disbanded. We currently don’t feel safe because the police are being harassed and unwanted because of a few terrible officers.

Eventually I would like to see a Public Safety Service that consists of Mental Health Workers, Social Workers, non-licensed investigators, non-licensed parking and traffic enforcement, and licensed police. The investigators would respond to calls that require someone to take a report but no suspect is present, such as a garage break in. The 911 Dispatchers will need extra training as they would be making the initial decision of who to send to the call. I would be in favor of the Hennepin County Sheriffs Dept to be in charge of a temporary police unit that would be hired and staffed to get the number of police officers needed to fill the gap until the new police department can be fully developed and trained. I believe that having a Public Safety Service that is primarily staffed with mental health and social work employees who are supported by police officers who understand their minimized support roll what our city needs."

The people who protect and serve our community should live here and represent all of us, not commute here to harass people they perceive as bad guys. I've worked with, am friends with and am even related to Minneapolis Police officers and know in my heart of hearts, that very few of them would speak out if they saw a fellow officer doing something wrong or hold themselves accountable for their own bias.

Who feels safe going downtown? Obviously not them if the are costing the city $500,000 per year in security. I used to feel safe here. Now, I don’t.

Things were completely out of control until the National Guard came in. Also, look at the shootings of 11 people that occurred in Uptown last week. I saw a video taken shortly before of complete chaos at Hennepin/Lake (rowdy crowds, cars spinning around on Hennepin and Lake, drag racing) and no police around.

I have been personally told by Linea Palmisano: ""they won't make meetings to meet with me!"" then YOU should attend their events. Listen to them speak. Be open to changing your mind.    Mayor Frey and many of the rest of city council are protecting the white supremacists who fund their campaigns. We understand that you are holding back from committing to end the police department because you are afraid of upsetting the status quo that is upheld by white people. Our city has tried police reform so many times. Giving more money to police departments is the opposite of the answer here. Schools, housing, food: we could be funding these instead."

The city must have the flexibility to develop and fund effective programs that will more comprehensively improve public safety for everyone in the city. I've lived in Minneapolis since 1985, and the MPD has always been violent, racist, and unaccountable, and their actions since the murder of George Floyd have done nothing but confirm that they are unwilling to change.

Why not add this instead of put all power to the city council...I like most of you now, but who knows who we could get later on. Good luck.

You should focus efforts on encouraging these communities to stop     hurting each other as that's where a majority of the crime is committed ............... not a few bad police of  ficers.

Police of  ficers are killed as well. In fact according to the FBI in 2018 150 were killed in the line of duty. Now what happened to Floyd was HORRIBLE. And should never happen again. But if anything, police need more funding for more training programs that implement stronger ties to their communities! You are putting social workers lives at risk by putting them on the frontlines to ""de- escalate"" a situation that they are not physically equipped for if it gets ugly! Will these social workers have weapons? Because a lot of these seemingly harmless cases turn violent within seconds. Gangs will be happy to hear that police are even further into the minority. I cannot believe what Minneapolis us trying to do. You try to humanize criminals by assuming that social work will heal their violent ways. And it is hopeful, but it is not reality.

In addition to work, I spend time in Minneapolis during the weekday evenings for dinners and happy hours and on the weekends frequenting concerts, shows at the Orpheum Theater, uptown restaurants, and Twin's baseball games. Since the killing of George Floyd there has already been a large increase in violence reported in Minneapolis (over 100+ shootings). It is my belief that the proposed amendment to disband or defund the Minneapolis Police Department would cause an even larger increase in criminal activity that would make it unsafe for me or my family to continue to spend time in Minneapolis. Assuming the proposal would leave even a smaller number of Police Offices (when I think a larger presence is currently needed) I would request to move to another office outside of Minneapolis or petition to work from home full time to avoid the area altogether.    In addition to my dollars no longer flowing into the CIty of Minneapolis, I also have grave fears on how the outcome of this experiment would affect the surrounding areas. I am concerned criminals would feel emboldened to commit crimes in surrounding cities and then flea to MPLS where the chances of being caught would be slim. Because I am unable to vote if the proposed amendment gets to that this November I am hopeful the voices of people who come to MPLS for work and play will also get to have their voices heard.

We have already seen the carnage that has been unleashed as officers have been forced to pull back in the wake of George Floyd's murder. The mayhem that has shocked many across the region and indeed the country as a whole, will undoubtedly become the norm should the MPD be culled drastically or removed from the equation altogether. The loss of businesses, residents, and visitors in droves will inevitably follow, and with it the effectual death of the Minneapolis we all knew and loved.  The vague proposals for these reforms mostly seem to center around replacing many if not all armed police with ""social workers"" and various ""community outreach"" efforts. Both of which already exist in spades across the city/county yet to what effect? What has the so-called Office of Violence Prevention -which if I am not mistaken, is sustained with hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars per year- actually done to prevent violence? Outreach groups such as MAD DADS were already present at the scene of the recent mass shooting in Uptown to seemingly no effect. Yet such entities are meant to be at the forefront of the ""community centric violence prevention efforts"" intended to supplant MPD. This city needs police, as a matter of life or death.

"6/30/2020 12:44:16 PM",6,"","","The MPD should not be dismantled. To do so and replace it with an inferior system of response is beyond reproach. Improvements can always be made in any organization and with proper execution and supervision may be effective and sustainable. Forgive the City Council for they do not know what they do. Minneapolis is my home and I have always felt it is where I belong. The police have always been responsive to me in non-emergency situations. I work in the education setting and have worked with police liaisons as a partner, never as an adversary. I thank God for law enforcement, fire fighters, the military and my freedom that they serve to uphold. Dismantle the PD and you will be back pedaling in no time."
"6/30/2020 12:44:30 PM",1,"","","Absolutely Not Our police force is needed now more then ever.Look at Powderhorn Park as one example of the futility of community policing.How many more teen age girls need to be raped?..how many more carjackings in the cities?..How many more bullets?.The hipster 30 somethings talk Big..no back up or common sense.YES to our wonderful police force"
"6/30/2020 12:44:45 PM",-5,"","","I strongly oppose removing the police department and adding a department of community safety and violence prevention. There is no plan in place and nobody has any idea what that will mean. Very disappointed in the city council."
"6/30/2020 12:44:53 PM",-2,"","","Please do not disband the Police Dept.  What a stupid idea!!  We need the police.  Without it we'll have mob control.  And you know it!!!  What we need is mature leadership!  I think the City Council should be replaced!  The cost of housing is skyrocketing,  taxes are out of control and the city council is more concerned with condos for the millionaires.  Meantime the homeless have to live in tents in the park.  Wake up!!!"
"6/30/2020 12:44:55 PM",-21,"","","No This is a poorly thought through idea. As a former resident and current employee as Fire Department Captain I’m totally agents this.  In the city where we need licensed police officers to provide safety to us and citizens on a multiple times a day  . Dealing with violent situations and life and death situations do not need no police intervention. We need swarm officers that can deal with violent criminal situations and securing the scene.  If this passes  I will not bring my children into any city event or place for their safety. What is happening now is a prime example of unchecked violent crime.  De fund the city council."
"6/30/2020 12:45:08 PM",0,"","","I work near the 3rd precinct, not a wonderful area but I always felt safe. Now I am apprehensive going to work and leaving.  I feel a police presence is needed even more so now, and more Police officers as well.  Having an additional tax on purchases in the city is enough to keep people from shopping there, but now police will add to that.  I have relatives and friends who live downtown and go to the suburbs to shop because of taxes, and now even more because of being afraid to leave their condo."
"6/30/2020 12:45:17 PM",8,"","","I support ammending the Minneapolis City Charter in such a way that it would end the current MPD and create a cCommission if Public Safety which could include armed police officers but would not be required to.

"6/30/2020 12:46:56 PM",-13,"","","Police reform, transformation, education, sensitivity/bias training, etc... but not interested whatsoever in this plan to remove the police from the city charter.  If this ever went on to the ballots, I will vote NO and so will almost every person I know.  Bad choice and has increased the crime in Minneapolis now that people aren't worried anyone will call the police because they don't have our own City Council's backing, people are shooting left and right with no fear of repercussion.  You should be supporting the police.  This is truly a shame and I hope you fix what you started.  This never needed to happen.. please make it right."
"6/30/2020 12:46:58 PM",0,"","","I do not believe that the Minneapolis City Charter should be changed.  I do not believe that MPD should be defunded and dismantled by the Minneapolis City Council. If placed on the ballot in November to change the Minneapolis City Charter so the Minneapolis City Council can Defund & Dismantle the MPD I will vote against it. My vote will be to keep the Minneapolis City Charter as is."
"6/30/2020 12:47:02 PM",-13,"","","Absolutely not, do not disband the Minneapolis Police Department.   Who will deal with human trafficking, sexual assault?   The Minneapolis Police were told by Frey to abandon the 3rd precinct.  Did that stop people from setting it on fire, no police presence and so did that stop the fires?  How about the post office?  No police presence, no fire department, what happened to the post office, did people go away?  Nope they did not, the post office went up in flames.  We need the police, and why does the city council have private security?"
"6/30/2020 12:48:32 PM",-13,"","","The Minneapolis city Council members all need to be immediately fired & publicly tarred and feathered. These lunatics suffer from psychosis & need to be placed into mental healthcare facilities. These asinine nincompoops are sick in the brain & should not hold public office in any capacity. I have never witnessed such a brainless group of individuals in my entire life. They are not only an embarrassment to the city of Minneapolis, but they are an embarrassment to the human species."
"6/30/2020 12:48:34 PM",-29,"","","I appose amending the Minneapolis charter that effectively eliminates the mention and funding for a police department. I also appose the clear imbalance in power away from the Mayors office and towards the Minneapolis City Council. While violent crime has risen over 69% in the last ten years the city couple wants to eliminate the requirement for a police department while grabbing more power in the process. No one questions there are major issues in the MPD but changing the cities charter without a plan is not the way to address the issue. Removing the police department will make Minneapolis a target for violent crime and leave a trail of tragic deaths and increasingly violent crime in its wake. The citizens and businesses of Minneapolis deserve protection from people intent on doing harm.  The City Council has acted in a rash and irresponsible manner in proposing these sweeping changes without input from citizens, or a plan to address the serious issues in front of our city. Doing this right will take time and hard work but grandstanding and distracting from the real work ahead will get us nowhere.  I urge you to reject this proposal so Chief Arradondo and the city of Minneapolis can get to work and begin to heal this city."
"6/30/2020 12:49:18 PM",0,"","","I have worked many years in Minneapolis. The ONLY way I felt comfortable taking a walk down Nicollet Mall during lunch time was knowing that for the most part it was somewhat safe.   I say somewhat because you still always had homeless people who are high on drugs yelling at you, plenty of family domestics being played out in the street and panhandlers who would yell at you and call you ""SATAN"" when you say you don't have any change. If you take away the police, you are taking away the people who enforce the laws and regulations YOU as the city council have approved and voted into law. To defund and remove the police but hire private security for yourselves reeks of elitism.  The 1% have private security.  Not the public servants. I am currently looking for a new job. If I see a job that is listed as being in Minneapolis, I am not applying to it.  Even if the dollar per hour is more than I make now. This will only hurt the city of Minneapolis and its residents. Crime will increase, residents will start to leave, tax revenue will decrease forcing the city to increase taxes which will speed up the exodus from Minneapolis. Be wise with your decisions. Think about the majority of your citizens who elected you and what they want to see happen."
"6/30/2020 12:51:16 PM",11,"","","I am fully in favor of defunding and replacing the Minneapolis Police Department. This charter amendment is a required step in that process and I want the commission to know that I want the ability to vote on this amendment at the first opportunity this coming November. Please expedite the process required to allow the citizens of Minneapolis to exercise our choice on this matter."
"6/30/2020 12:52:41 PM",0,"","","I am absolutely opposed to this charter change. While I believe the MPD needs reform particularly with the union, this proposal as written gives no detail or plan. As a resident, I am tired of a city council with certain individuals voted in by a small percentage of residents controlling the whole city.  This change takes power away from the Mayor and I am opposed to that.  I also object to the way this was rammed down with no time for public input. You did not listen to the overwhelming negative feedback to the 2040 plan and I hope you listen this time. Just know the City Council has very little trust of the residents that you will listen and be thoughtful about the change we do need."
"6/30/2020 12:52:53 PM",9,"","","I support the transitioning of funds from policing to more effective community resources that prevent the need for crime in the first place. I share the hesitancy that many people do about not knowing what that may look like. Our community is not yet safe, and we trust you to do the footwork to ensure that we have the resources needed to be safe and healthy."
"6/30/2020 12:53:08 PM",-2,"","","Do you have another document that spells out in a lot more detail what the program encompasses and how laws will be enforced? The lack of clarity on this issue leads to anxiety on the side of many law-abiding citizens as it unclear specifically how they will be protected. Very specific information, a lot more communication from the city, and a clear understanding that you are really being thorough and are realistic may be needed from you to get more community buy in from those who are apprehensive.  I lived in north Minneapolis for 12 years; no longer live there but I still serve the community and city but I do work there and am invested in it’s success."
"6/30/2020 12:54:56 PM",3,"","","The way this is written, there is no way I would vote for this amendment. It explains very little about what would actually happen or what it means and leaves me with many questions: -Are you going to demote our first black Police chief? Why does the director need to NOT have law enforcement training?  -Are you finally going to do something in this city about all the problems that lead to crime? All I've seen this council manage to do is build massive amounts of housing that seems to be for people with money while the homeless population in Minneapolis grows. Where are the treatment facilities for addicts? The housing and help for youth who struggle? The employment opportunities for POC? The mental health services needed? The help for neighborhoods (Like my own) dealing with gun violence and crime? I have very little confidence that what you have in this charter will make any difference in how many ""gun shots or fireworks"" conversations I have with my neighbors at night.  -What do you even envision what this would look like? I am glad to see that there is still some form of law enforcement in this charter. There are way too many guns in this city unfortunately to not have armed police. But what about the rest of the needs? Who comes for a mental health breakdown? Domestic dispute? Burglary? You have a concept here but nothing to tell me that convinces me to vote in favor.  In order for me to vote for an amendment like this I need to see much more community involvement (not just a few days to respond online!). Mostly, I need to feel like I trust the council and honestly I don't at this point. If they have't put the needs of the community over big business and developers these last few years, how do I trust that will change? I have zero confidence in what I have seen so far. I feel like you'll just cut police, not put the needs of the community and POC at the front and we will see homelessness, crime and addiction go up."
"6/30/2020 12:55:29 PM",-1,"","","Different name but the game would be the same. Try reforming what we already have. Start with looking at complaints on record for all officers. Where’s there’s smoke, there’s fire. Then work with leaders of BLM and other POC agencies to work together for reform. There’s a lot of great officers out there already. We just need more of them."

Please explain to me why you have to dismantle the force to make changes in how arbitration works. I will move out of Minneapolis if you disband the police and I'm born and raised in the city. Your 2040 Plan sucks.  Packing people into highrise housing is not the answer -  More bike lanes is not the answer.  Closing parkways and lakes from car traffick is not the answer.   Your ideas on how to govern a major metropolis come from inexperience and naiveté. Worse city council EVER!  I'm 68 years old and have lived in Minneapolis my entire life."

I think the city council is frought with inexperienced members who seem prepared to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater."" For now, I think that's a big mistake.  I encourage the council to form a police review committee consisting of respected leaders, black, white, Hispanic and others...with a goal of making recommendation for law enforcement reform. And don't rush this to meet a November election deadline. Minneapolis needs a well functioning law enforcement structure to effectively serve the people of the community.

Police are a much needed resource for the city, and rather than reducing their numbers, how about rethinking the arbitration process.  If the process of hiring, training and discipline were researched and revised, we would have a police force which would meet the needs of everyone.  Please, please, please let cooler heads prevail on this important process."
"6/30/2020 1:01:05 PM",-11,"","","While I am in favor of some needed changes to how police respond/detain/arrest people in the city of minneapolis, I am NOT in favor of eliminating the police force.  There is too much violent crime, drugs, gangs and theft for the city to rid itself of the much needed protection that is needed for those that strive for peace.  I would choose NOT to visit the city of minneapolis if they eliminate the police department.  I would not feel safe.  It was a tragedy how Floyd died.  He was murdered.  Justice needs to be done and swifty to the officers involved so the public knows police are not untouchable.  The police union is what needs to be elimated.  The union protects the ""bad apples"" that make the whole organization look bad."
"6/30/2020 1:02:26 PM",-26,"","","No. No. No. No to remove/abolish the Mpls Police Dept.  Lisa Bender and her band of nitwits on the Mpls City Council have no idea what they're doing.  Please go on line and google some of the comments the national public has made about Bender wanting to abolish the MPD.  What kind of integrity and intellectual capability can a person aka the Mpls City Council President! have if they make national statements to abolish the police force and then tell the world that they have no idea what the alternative plan for public safety is???  Please, someone with some smarts on the Charter Commission, think about the fact that all Bender is doing is making a political maneuver to cover her ass for doing nothing to avoid the George Floyd murder under her watch.  We absolutely MUST support Police Chief Arradondo --    a man of integrity and poise who wants to do the right thing for his city AND the FIRST black police chief in Mpls.  Give him some time to let him do his job! And disregard sociopath Bender.  In addition, what's the rush???  I thought Bender said initially there was going to be a year long period to research alternatives and gather public input.  What happened to that?!?!?!  In conclusion, I'm copying a highly intelligent post from a former Mpls Police Officer who happens to be a black female:  Repost from Lisa Clemens regarding police disbanding ammendmemt. IT'S A LONG POST BUT READ IT PLEASE: IF I CAN Be HONEST...AS I ALWAYS AM. I never care about who gets pissed at me for telling the TRUTH. I was a Minneapolis Police Officer for 13 years. I PROUDLY wore that uniform. There will be no cops standing up to say racism does not exist in MPD. In TRUTH no person in any job will say that. If they do, they are a liar...Plain and simple. I sued MPD 2 times, as a police officer and I won...It never made me not want to wear my uniform. Chief Arradondo and 5 other males sued MPD and won. It never made them want to stop wearing the uniform. It made us spend even more time talking to cops about change. It was not until Chief Arradondo became the Chief and DC Arthur Lee Knight became the Deputy Chief did I start to believe in change. THIS CHIEF has fired and demoted more cops than any of his predecessors. Chief Arradondo would NEVER offer up that information, because he is a man of character and it’s nothing to brag about... It happens when you are making REAL change. NEVER have a I seen a chief who has strong relationship with EVERY COMMUNITY and is inclusive of ALL people. NEVER have I seen a Chief pick up a phone and call Boots on the Ground organizations and Clergy to say I NEED YOU in an area of the City. I don't want to dispatch police officers unless you say you need one. NEVER have I seen a Chief make a policy that allows him to IMMEDIATELY fire an officer..... Something other Cities are already looking to copy. NEVER have I seen a Chief beat up so badly by a City Council from the first day he accepted his appointment....and they do it PUBLICLY. Never has a Chief been asked to change 150 years of a culture in 3 years with no support from anyone but the community....Knowing a City Council is waiting in the wings for any errors to pounce on you and finding ways to cripple you by asking you to do mor with less. In the last budget Cycle a few on the council asked an organization come in and ask that $1 million dollars be divested from MPD to be given to organizations in the community. I asked why they wouldn’t take 1% from EVERY department under the City. Of course they went silent. But IF THEY HAD here is that breakdown: 1% of city budget: approximately $18 million 1% of city departments: Best guess is between $9-15 million 1% of MPD: approximately $1.5 million The community got the short end of the stick because that $1 Million didn’t really come to the community....Poli-tricks! Since 2000 I have been working in the community, predominantly in North Minneapolis because that's where I grew up when we moved to the Great City of Minneapolis Attachment: IT'S A LONG POST BUT READ IT PLEASE: IF I CAN Be HONEST...AS I ALWAYS AM.

Since 2000 I have been working in the community, predominantly in North Minneapolis because that's where I grew up when we moved to the Great City of Minneapolis. Where I PROUDLY graduated from North High school and where I was blessed to work as a Patrol Officer and as a Street Sergeant. In fact, both Chief Arradondo and DC Knight worked for me when I ran a team out of Minneapolis Public Housing. I hand-picked my officers who were ALL BLACK and one White. I was the first training officer of DC Knight... Both of whom came from single Black poor mothers in Chicago. Over the last 6 years I have been STRICTLY Boots on the Ground in North Minneapolis and Downtown... and sometimes in South Minneapolis. My team, A Mothers Love, was formed to help the City realize that Saving the Black Mother WILL SAVE the Black child. The Black mother has ALWAYS been the group not brought to the table so our voices were never heard. The first person to call on us was the Minneapolis Police Department and since we have been working closely with great people in all communities. WHY did the Deputy Chief call us? Because Black Police Officers know WHO the Black man, Black son, Black nephew, Black Grandson, etc has a strong love and respect for. In the good and bad,,,,,They love and respect us...Because Black female officers are great at de-escalation because majority of us came from the life many are living. I can tell you with 100% Truth: The Minneapolis City Council has put no real time in weighing the danger of dismantling/abolishing the police. THIS, no matter what perfume they spray on it, will get people killed, even more in MY COMMUNITY. They like to say that my point of view is a scare tactic...hmmmm and you telling someone calling for help makes you a White Supremacist. If a Black wants to call what would be the name for them? I don’t do politics so I’ll never put a vote before a life. I don’t have an agenda. As it stands, there are MANY Boots On The Ground Organizations out here doing GREAT work but the TRUTH has to be told. WE have lost control of what is happening in the community. Many of US have not given up, nor will we. Like the police we run from call to call to call. The shootings, Homicides and other crimes absolutely drain you, but we keep going. I felt the same way when I was wearing BLUE. One would only have to listen to a scanner for 24 hours to know the TRUTH. Selling people UTOPIA when you have no plan for all the other dangers and issues in a City the size of Minneapolis is INSANE. When Minneapolis decided to go even bigger as a City, they opened the door for more Crime, including Sex Trafficking.... To now say we don’t need the police is simply crazy. If they are going to have a year long conversation why are they seeking to change the charter before those conversation even start...PLEASE open your eyes to this vote me back in in 2021 game. When I say the City Council is dangling a shiny object in front of people eyes I mean that....MPD is the EASY Button and the only thing on their agenda. EVERY PUBLIC SAFETY MEETING has been focused on the police and NEVER the escalating violence in the community...Now City Wide This is a City that still can't find housing for our most vulnerable. A City that when I BEGGED them to help us address the issues on Broadway/Lyndale last Summer NO ONE would call me back.... But when those vulnerable drug addicted people were mowed down in the Bus shelter RACISM is what they screamed....But they still NEVER came to give us any help nor any resources. We had soooooo many overdoses on that corner and still no help. If it's racism that nearly killed them when the White male driver mowed them down, what do we call it when OUR OWN are on that corner EVERYDAY feeding them the dope that causes those over doses? The price of doing business? We don't want the police saying anything to these people LOITERING with INTENT to kill with Drugs.... MOST OF YOU are too afraid to even approach....... How would you do that in the City Councils UTOPIA? Remember, Adults can refuse to go to treatment...Hence all the addicts in the parks that I pray for EVERY DAY. A few years ago, I attended several meetings between Hennepin County and Ramsey County about a joint YOUTH Treatment facility, to be built between the 2 cities, so that families could be part of the treatment process. I thought YES finally someone understands WE and other communities have a drug problem with our kids....Of course a group came in to shut down the idea saying, 'Our kids don't have a drug problem. This is just another pipeline to prison."" I was in ABSOLUTE SHOCK. There is NO DOUBT we have a drug problem with our youth...IN ALL DAMN COMMUNITIES. I stood up and said, ""Are you kidding!!! We ABSOLUTELY have a drug and alcohol problem in our community. If you think these young people are pulling these triggers sober then I am even more afraid."" I believed the facility should have been built with US being part of it every step of the way. It should have been Culturally Competent and the programs should have been designed by US to ensure our kids and their family’s needs are met. After one more meeting at the Minneapolis Urban League, with the same group shutting it down, Hennepin County and Ramsey County pulled and we continue to deal with drug overdoses and deaths of our young people and our girls strung out and being sex trafficked....EVERY ACTION is knee-jerked with no other plan or option and the loudest mouths sets the rules...... Because people let them. While I believe all voices should be heard....Is that what’s happening in Minneapolis or is the Council seeking like thinkers and exploiting them for their own personal agendas. Perhaps it might be too late when people really figure it out. In TRUTH, I and MANY others, lived through Murderapolis. I wore BLUE at the time and the REAL TRUTH is we worked strong with Black Pastors, the community as a whole, organizations throughout the City, Neighborhood Associations and retired gang members to bring the City back in control. EVERYBODY worked as a team.... No one saw color of skin nor the color of your clothes. That was when Minneapolis understood the term ALL HANDS ON DECK. I stand STRONG on the need for Police Reform but I stand equally strong on the need for Community Reform. EMAIL THE CHARTER COMMISSION AND ASK QUESTION... I'll attach their email info. Ask yourself WHY the Council is in a rush without a plan... before the ""yearlong conversations"". WHY they have addressed the MEDIA more than the voters....PAUSE AND THINK My mom will be 84 years old in July and she lives in Ward 4, as do my oldest sister. My mom is on edge about this and I KNOW I will go protect her AT ALL COST"
"6/30/2020 1:04:24 PM",6,"","","This is an excellent update to the charter - emphasizing that, yes, we need law enforcement, but more than that we need holistic work to improve public safety for ALL residents and reduce violence . Thank you!"
"6/30/2020 1:05:00 PM",-16,"","","I believe that our police department needs to be improved, better training, the ability to fire and remove those officers that are not doing their job.  It is greatly concerning that the union has such power and can override the chief's position.  It makes sense when there is something that is questionable but when we have officers who are breaking the law or are clearly violating policy, then why should they have protection for their jobs.  Any one of us would lose our jobs.  I am lacking confidence in the Mayors leadership at this time and this brings concern.  I have little confidence in our city council's ability to do the job.  I appreciate the diversity on the council and had hopes that this would make a difference.  What I am most concerned about is that they have spoken quickly, used terms that I feel are inciting fear and panic to the residents and feel that their actions were careless.  As a mental health clinician, people are already dealing with the affects of a pandemic; significant loss, changes, etc.  We then witness the tragedy of a black man murdered at the hands of police officers followed by riots and destruction of our city.  Many neighborhoods are already in a position where crime is higher and with fewer responses, lack of police support and then to hear that the council votes to disband the police.  Now people are worried that there won't be any police at all.  Again, the verbiage they are using is inaccurate and careless.   I think that they should have had a plan in place.  I think they should have been more thoughtful in how they communicate this message out to the residents of the city.  I think that what the council has done is reckless and careless.  If anyone of us working in other business would walk in, say things without having a plan, etc, it wouldn't go over well or possibly lose a job.  The council has yet to put forth a plan or communicate what this would look like.  The election is coming soon and these individuals likely won't be in office to finish the plan.  I know that I will absolutely vote against my council member.  I voted him in during the last election but feel he has failed our fourth precinct."
"6/30/2020 1:05:24 PM",-1,"","","I do not support this charter amendment. It seems that the Council is being reactive instead of proactive on this subject. We need a police force - not THIS police force, but we need some kind of police force to deal with homicides, etc. Most important for this new police force is community/civilian oversight, accountability, and insurance carried by MPD/individual officers rather than the City. As it stands, it's broken. We need change. We NEED change! But this doesn't seem to be the correct approach. I also know the Police Officers Federation and human piece of garbage Bob Kroll are a major speed bump on the road to change. If we need to make a last ditch, drastic effort to overcome this obstacle, then so be it! I just have no reason to believe we've reached that point. If I've misunderstood the proposed amendment and we're on the same page, I apologize - I didn't have a ton of time to assembly my thoughts today. Did my best. Thank you all"

I think the city council needs to study the issue and come up with a plan, present it to the public, and only then seek to amend the charter.  The public needs to know what the Community of Safety and Violence Prevention department will look like, what it will do, how it differs from the current Police Department, and how racism, poverty, and how crime will be adequately addressed.  Without first making this information available, this proposed amendment seems like putting the cart before the horse."

There has been a too long standing issue of protecting officers gone bad.  It cannot be denied that it is a ridiculously difficult job at the outset and one with untold risks of health and safety. A dual system of community based safety and violence prevention should go hand and hand with protect and serve. Again, I am opposed to removing a police force from the city charter.

The unnecessary and uncontrollable destruction by the general public which recently occurred recently is proof. We  cannot depend on the general public to always know how to behave properly, because historically they have always had ways of being destructive instead of creative in positive ways. Wars and other examples of destruction throughout history are proof of this fact. It is important to have staff who have skill to properly research and determine ongoing crimes of any kind whether we like it or not. Involvement within the social work field may be helpful and could even reduce the amount of financial support needed by the city to assist the public, but may not be enough of a threat to discourage the general public from committing criminal activity. It would also take a long time to establish the suggested Prevention Department by training, educating, and providing needed   staff and may not be immediately achievable The current suggestion goes too much to the extreme and needs to be reconsidered. The State of Minnesota may also need to make changes in it's gun control laws before changes of this nature occur to prevent increased gun purchases by the general public as part of their own desires and intentions to learn to protect themselves as a result of feeling they may not longer be able to simply contact the police while or during a robbery attempt, being raped, sexually abused, etc"

So, I want the mayor to be in charge of law enforcement, not the city council.  Although I consider myself a liberal Democrat, I'm beginning to think the City Council is totally out of touch with what residents want and more into stereotypical touchy-feeling things.  It seems they take the most extreme positions without taking into account what the actual situation is in Minneapolis, and trying to make policy based on that uniqueness.  In other words, it may be cool to say do away with the police department, but I'm afraid the City Council doesn't think things through and come up with good policy for our city."

I can tell you that the thing people fear in MPLS is NOT law enforcement.  When I check out my travel plans and places I need to visit in MPLS, it's not so I can avoid if possible or prepare for encountering police.  It's to avoid or prepare for encountering the countless people wishing to do me harm or take my stuff.  You see...it's a bizzarro world scenario to think cops are the dangerous part of your city-no matter your ethnicity.  Cops are a threat to those who do bad things.  Cops are SUPPOSED to be a threat to people who do bad things.  Cops should avoid harming or killing people who do bad things...and they do.  They RARELY kill someone while every single day you have bad guys attempting to kill someone in your city. Stop thinking so abstractly and recognize that the only substantial threat in the city is from non law enforcement people with bad intent.  You need more cops and you need to unleash them more to put the fear of God in the bad guys. Rather than reigning cops in, you need to push them to extinguish crime by any means possible.  Then people will be happy to come to your city and spend their money there.  I can't imagine going to MPLS if there is no real, armed and substantial police presence-and I'm one of the people who brings money to your city.  Use some straight up logic on this.  PS- drop the political correctness. Let's be honest-I don't know the exact data, but I'd bet you money that a disproportionate amount of violent crime in the city is perpetrated by people of color.  I-in no way-think that in racist terms, it's just a fact. I don't think you're destined to be criminals because of your ethnic makeup.  It's a choice.  But too many of those making the choice to commit violent crimes in the city are POC.  So it's no wonder when police are wary of people of color, because they know most of those that are a threat are people of color.  And because of this, the people they will be on the lookout for will be people of color.  I don't want it to be that way and neither do you, so what do we do about it? Well.... I'd start with making it clear to everyone regardless of ethnicity that no crime will be tolerated in any way and make sure everyone understands that the only way there will be a harmonious relationship with law enforcement is for the culture of the city to change regardless of your ethnicity."

It’s a punitive move, not a rationale, strategic move.  Quick moves, based on emotion, and an absence of proven examples of success, will lead to waste, harm, and continued challenges.

The creation of a department of community safety and violence prevention, replacing the existing police department is an important step in shifting the priorities of our city and our tax dollars. We will still need crime prevention and criminal investigatory abilities, but we do not need to send traditional police to address mental health crises, many domestic abuse situations would be better served with trained intervention and service provision to the person facing the abuse rather than cops showing up and threatening to arrest everyone since they aren't trained to 'sort things out'. We should be investing in jobs, housing, low cost health care, career training, and so on, so that the pressures of daily life are mitigated as contributing factors to unrest and crime.

I had already lost trust in the department after years of their obvious racial discrimination in countless incidents and their protecting of clearly guilty officers. But how the MPD handled themselves in the weeks of the protests and the riots removed any faith I had in them at all. Living in Phillips neighborhood we were terrorized by police simply for sitting on our front porches. Their displays through the neighborhood did not make anyone feel safer. And especially not on the Thursday after the riots started when a young Somali man was shot and killed on 14th Avenue and was left dying in the street for 30 minutes before police arrived on the scene. As he bled out on the street police and NG were clearly only blocks away running their sirens, scaring us into our homes, flying low over our houses in helicopters and parading armored vehicles through our neighborhood. It is 100% clear to me that the MPD does NOT care about the people of this city. It's time for something new. Whether it is a completely new police force that does not hire any of the old cops back or an entirely new type of security ot needs to be reflective of the people who live here. We need officers of color, multilingual officers and officers trained in deescalation."

However, we must be judicious and thoughtful about the way we do it.  Disbanding and otherwise “defunding” the police department is not the way to go.  We need true reform.  We need to reduce or eliminate the power that the police union has to protect officers who infringe on people’s civil rights under the guide of “keeping the peace”. We should bring back the requirement that an officer live in the precinct that he or she patrols; the officer would be much more invested in his or her own community, that on into which he or she commutes every day.

Your blanket categorization as all Mpls cops as bad is exactly the type of stereotyping you claim to be against.  You will run every business out of the city (more than you already have) and most law abiding citizens.

However, I cannot overstate how crucial it is to ensure restorative justice be a foundational pillar of this new department. Our current criminal justice system is punitive and inherently racist. It harms the victim, offender and the community. Victims are often powerless and rarely find closure. Offenders are isolated and punished, rather than given the opportunity for rehabilitation. Restorative justice reduces recidivism and builds a stronger community, which is precisely the goal of this new department. I urge you to employ restorative justice as the bedrock of this new department."

I live in downtown Minneapolis.  We need to have police officers.  We need a visible police presence.  I cannot imagine a city without police officers, and I probably wouldn't live in one.

"6/30/2020 1:26:21 PM",23,"","","See attached statement To:  Minneapolis Charter Commission Date:  June 29, 2020 I am writing to request that the Minneapolis Charter Commission do a thorough and informed consideration of the City Council’s proposed Police Charter Amendment before taking your action and returning it to the Mayor and City Council. As one who has spent her entire life in Minneapolis, much of it in public service, I feel very strongly about this matter.  As the wife of an African American man, every day I live knowing the complex relationship between communities of color and the police.  I worry about him every day. But when my house was burglarized in the middle of the night – not once but three times – we called the police.  They responded with speed and professionalism.  There is clearly need for substantial change within the department and its relationship to the community, but this proposed charter change does not accomplish that.  Rather, it would effectively eliminate the Police Department and fundamentally change Minneapolis city government.  This is a substantial change that should not be rushed or put on the “fast track.” The idea of putting something on the “fast track” takes on new meaning during the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is my experience that public hearings, testimony, public engagement and all the things we rely on for transparency in government has been compromised during this time.  While everyone is trying to do their best, there are new challenges for people obtaining information and participating in deliberations of public bodies.  This is particularly true for our low income and senior populations who may, or may not have access to the technology needed to participate.  Putting an item of this significance on the “fast track” at a time when citizen’s abilities to participate are compromised does not contribute to clear, transparent decision making.  It is the responsibility of the Charter Commission to ensure that the citizens can make an informed choice.  We rely on you to fulfill that role and appreciate your service to Minneapolis. I oppose the Council’s proposed Police Charter Amendment for three reasons: (1)   It is premature.  The amendment eliminates the Police Department without a plan.  Before the citizens are asked to vote on the elimination of the Police Department, there should be a plan in place that insures law enforcement and how the transition to a new system will be implemented without a loss of public safety protection for our citizens. (2)  Accountability of diminished.  It is simply not good public policy for the proposed Division of Law Enforcement Services, the Director of Community and Violence Protection or any public safety department to report to 15 bosses. This clearly diminishes accountability to the citizens, adds unneeded confusion and bureaucracy and diffuses authority, making it more distant from the citizens. (3)  Lack of commitment to law enforcement services.  The language in the proposed charter change replaces the words “must establish, organize and otherwise provide for these departments” with the words “may maintain a division of law enforcement services.”  Changing from “must” to “may” is a change that gives the citizens no guarantee of public safety services.  This is simply unfathomable.   Finally, the date of having this all accomplished and in place by May 1, 2020 is simply unattainable.  Let us not forget that we are in a COVID-19 environment.  As I said earlier, decision making and public input are more complex and time consuming in this environment and it doesn’t appear that is changing any time soon.  This is a major undertaking.  The council has said there will be a “year long” process – which is it, May 1 or a “year long” process.  I firmly believe that the discourse with the public should occur before amending the Charter – not after.  To amend the Charter without citizen input and without a plan in place would be irresponsible and put our City at risk. I love this city.  I have lived here my whole life.  I have raised my family here.  I have given much of my life I public service of our city.  I stand with you to help make our city better and stronger - to rush this Charter change forward without robust citizen engagement and a plan in place would, in my opinion, be irresponsible. Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter."

I think the City Council is severely overestimating resident support for elimination of the police department.  As often occurs in politics, the loudest voices don't always represent the majority and I believe any such amendment will fail to pass a vote by residents. I support ongoing reform and reinvention of the safety component of City services, but don't trust the out-of  -touch City Council with a complete overhaul.  The progressive-leaning City Council, in control for decades, has failed on many counts to effectively run the City.  I don't believe the Council can lead such a major structural change successfully and fear the uncertainty ahead should the Council be granted this responsibility.   I'd suggest the voters be asked to allow for an alternative department by simply adding OR to the below under 7.2 (a).   (11) a police department OR a department of community safety and violence prevention (section 7.3);  This would allow discussions on deeper reform that may be necessary to challenge the power of the police union.  It would allow the City to explore alternatives and even implement them, but always allow for going back to the current system of community safety if needed.  Finally, given politics always being involved, I do not support any public unions (all should be abolished) and I do not support the City Council being responsible for sole oversight of community safety as is proposed.

Rather than abolishing the police department and replacing it with untried and unproven alternatives, we, as a city, would be in a better position to try some pilot programs in targeted areas.

Dismantling police is an idea so beyond reason, so without critical thought, and so childish that it seems unbelievable to me. Unfortunately, the notion to dismantle the MPD is actually floating through the collective vacuous mind of the Minneapolis City Council. How does one explain this? I can only assume simple stupidity is not the answer, yet in my mind sheer stupidity is the only explanation I can think of that even begins to explain the MCC’s astounding lack of clear thinking and sense. If this idea to dismantle the MPD becomes a reality the violence that will result will make the violence in Chicago seem like child’s play, and the city will burn! I love Minneapolis and am the neighbor anyone would hope to have. I watch out for you, I blow the snow from your sidewalk, I treat all with respect and offer help if I see need.

I do not support the striking of the police department and replacing with a department of community safety and violence prevention.  Certainly not without a vetted, solid plan in place to replace them.   2. I am NOT in favor of ""b) division of law enforcement services"" which states the ""Council MAY maintain a division of law enforcement services"" when it should say ""WILL maintain a division of law enforcement services"". A city of this size must have a law enforcement department.  3. There are not enough details in the proposed amendment that adequately address the day to day workings of this proposed new department, especially compared to the striken language and the remaining fire department language.  4. Why is not the fire department a part of the community safety department? Most jurisdictions that have a public safety department do so for cost savings to combine law enforcement and fire.  5.  If any action should be taken with regards to the city charter, that would be to decrease the  number of city councilpersons from the board.  Having too many has caused the priorities of the council to become too narrow and myopic in nature.   I, too, want reform and I want changes in how the police department functions, how officers are disciplined, and funding levels spent. I want to see specifics about how any new system will work before I can consider myself informed enough to support any reform. I want the opportunity to provide comments on proposed changes. The timeline of this amendment and rush to get onto the November ballot does not afford this opportunity. Please consider not approving.  I would rather give the current Police Chief the opportunity to make changes he was hired to make.   Thank you for your service on this Commission."

It is only going to get worse until the community understands that well articulated PLAN and knows issues will be addressed properly.  NO clue what is happening, I understood there is only going to be ONE listening session (not anywhere near enough).  My councilmember does not acknowledge my questions, nor answers them.

"6/30/2020 1:33:15 PM",8,"","","Hi!  As a resident of Minneapolis I really want the City Council to sit back and really think through what is being asked.  It feels that a select few are reacting based on emotions and not really doing their due diligence, talking to community leaders to see what is needed for the  City of Minneapolis.  I for one do not want us to lose our Police Chief nor our good officers.   These are the things in my opinion on what needs to be accounted for; 1.  Changes need to be made top down- legislation  needs to be in lock step with what changes are being made in the city charter.  Police Union contract needs to be renegotiated.   2. How would criminal cases be handled now if we have Mental Health workers and the community resources?  How would evidence be handled, how would a case be brought together.  Will these mental heath workers and Community resources know what needs to be done?  Will they have training?  3.  The Minneapolis Police department from what I understand hired Mental health workers to go out on calls. Why is that program not expanded to add more types of these workers.  How was it working? 4.  If we get rid of the police will 911 now have to figure out what kind of person needs to be sent to a call?  I can’t imagine these calls are cut and dry.   Are non police resources prepared for violent situations? 5.  What impact is this going to have on trying to bring in big sporting events, conventions, tourism?  6.  What impact will this have on the businesses in Minneapolis?  7.  Allow the Police Chief to have more discipline control over his/her departments. 8.  Maybe this is the time to bring in an outside source or our community leaders and have all police officers reapply for their jobs Clean house and then there is a new timeline to say - the old way is gone we are now as of this date having a brand new police department.   Let’s make the city great again- A place where people want to come and visit.  A place where everyone is treated equally.    I believe that more thought has been put into all of this however, it is more than likely getting lost in  all the rhetoric and mis information going around.    Thank you!"

Instead, what you have to do is implementing improved and revised police training to prevent accidental death of the suspect and to improve the current police procedure of investigation. I don't think the member of the councils have knowledge of how much of stress the law enforcement faces daily and still most of polices are very good, dedicated to our communities and sacrificing their lives in front line.  Just because of few unprofessional polices dismantling whole police department is just not fair to all other good and dedicating polices.  Stop listening to the whining people. People should follow the law and order to keep our community safe. It feels unhappy if you are being investigated, but get ourselves clear from being suspected we mush comply to the police. What you have to announce is not planning to dismantle the police department, but to announce that people must follow to police investigate when being investigated by police. I simply mean complying to them.  Sometimes it is much easier to remove whole than to fix the small part of problem then pretend the problem has never existed."

We do not yet have an identified scope of responsibilities for the new department of community safety and violence prevention, yet we are setting a date to sunset the MPD and replace it with this un-scoped department by May 1, 2021. That gives us only 6 months from ratification to determine what that department will look like and do.  I DO support amending the charter to permit this change, but not require it. But I need to now how the leader of the department would be held accountable. I do not support the notion that the leader would report to the full council, as it dilutes accountability of council members. The buck has to stop at one desk, and I favor it stopping at the mayor's desk.

The MPD Union has way too much power, Kroll has to go. The City Council members need to do ride alongside for a month straight to actually see what officers face on a minute by minute shift. We are fast becoming another out of control Chicago. Police need better training and everyone combined needs to look at other cities who have successfully done reform.

We, the tax paying residents of Minneapolis don't have access to the PUBLIC's tax dollars for private personal protection like some City Council members seem to have taken the liberty to utilize so we nee the Police Department for our personal property and individual protection.   I believe disbanding the Police Union should be something that is being discussed and voted on.  I (now) recognize there have been police issues that have not been addressed and some individuals that may have been unjustly protected by the Union and this cannot continue.  That said - I want the protection a Police Department provides the City and it saddens me, as a 5 year resident that chose to relocate to Minneapolis from Texas, that I will feel the need to move out of the City of Minneapolis if the proposed charter amendment is approved in November.

"6/30/2020 1:38:06 PM",38,"","","I am not a resident of Minneapolis, but I work in Minneapolis and I have spent a lot of time attending many various types of events, concerts, restaurants, etc in the city. I absolutely do not support removing the Minneapolis Police Department and replacing it with the Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department.  I absolutely don't agree with trying to defund the police department at all either.  Quite the contrary I would hope that Minneapolis would start fully funding and publicly supporting it's police force.  The majority of great officers and the thousands of positive interactions of the those officers every year are being overshadowed unfairly. Look at the hard statistics that can't be manipulated for or against the departments record. I don't believe in the broad baseless claim that it's a racist department or has systemic racism built into it. Show us the PROOF that this exists if this is part of what the city council is claiming as a reason for making this drastic change. Public safety and policing needs to get further away from the manipulation of politics and focused more on protecting the public through the enforcement of laws that are on the books. If the Minneapolis City Council wants certain laws to change or be enforced differently, then they should be working with legislators to work together for those changes. The Chief and Union of the MPD have been requesting hundreds of more officers to keep the Minneapolis communities safe and those need to be provided and fully funded.  More officers, more money for training, equipment, education and absolutely more support from their leaders to help push forward a united front with it's citizens to keep Minneapolis safe for it's residents and all of the visitors that may or may not come based on how this is handled. Minneapolis needs to provide the VERY best police for it's citizens and build an AMAZING reputation of safety to attract visitors and great events to our city.  I would hope that this council would work with MPD to make it the best police force in the country that great officers would want to work for and where they are supported by their leaders and given all they need to be successful in their duties. If you want great people, with great skills to become great cops for the city of Minneapolis, YOU have to make it a great destination for them to work.  It can't be a department seen as a place where you have no backing from any of the leadership, where you won't have the numbers of cops on the streets to provide the safety you need not only for it's residents and visitors, but also the cops themselves to safely do their jobs and make it home every night to their families.  It will not work to replace MPD with a brand new Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department. This change would not draw or provide Minneapolis with the quality applicants who Minneapolis needs to keep us all safe whether we live, work or visit here. This drastic change will lead to more crime across the board and leave the people that need the most protection vulnerable to becoming victims of this crime wave.  The numerous functions that the Minneapolis Police Department provides can not be wiped clean and switched into a new department without putting all the people in or visiting Minneapolis at great and dire risk of criminal activity.   Put all your efforts and money into making the Minneapolis Police Department into the destination for all the great officers and make Minneapolis known as one of the safest large cities in the world by supporting them with all the resources they need to do that."

However, I do agree there needs to be major reform in the police department and judicial system as a whole.  I agree with providing funding for more training in deescalation and anti bias policing.  I do agree that there are calls made to 911 that do not require police as the primary responder, but rather, people trained in dealing with human behavior, addictions, etc.   I understand that the money for these changes will be substantial and agree that most of it should come from the police department; if they cannot/will not be trained in a way that makes all citizens feel safe in their own city, they should not have access to the money that can help train people who actually do want to help people.  The amount of money the city has had to pay to the families of victims of police brutality is ridiculous and the police department has cost the taxpayers enough for their bad choices.  However, instead of “throwing the baby out with the bath water”, I do recognize there are “good” police and there are also situations that the police are the correct response.  The police do Often exacerbate situations, but we need to understand that as a city, there will be crime and violence. Unless the city has a proven way of eliminating poverty, racism, and the other ills of a metropolitan area, crime will continue.  If the police are dismantled without a very clear, concise, research based plan, people will not trust the city of Minneapolis to keep them safe.  People will move to the suburbs or other areas.  Tourists will not feel safe to come and spend money in our city.  Sports fans will not be eager to come cheer their favorite teams.  The main point is, dismantle the police and you will have a financial crisis on your hands.  Is this something the council is prepared to deal with?

"6/30/2020 1:43:47 PM",12,"","","My thoughts are that we should most certainly move forward with decreasing the budget of the police department, or defund the MPD as a whole. There could potentially be a rehiring process with new expectations for officers, as well. The idea of entirely eliminating the department seems amazing, but I struggle with the reality of that move. I feel like more people will revolt either internally or with force. If the MPD will essentially becomes the CSVPD, then that is different, but that would have to be explicitly communicated with the public. There is no room for vague phrasing in this conversation. The more direct, the better. Let me be clear in that I do fully support the notion of defunding the police because previous attempts of reform have fallen short. I think that we should instead decrease the budget away from the MPD around things like homelessness or mental health and allow situations like that to be handled through other agencies that are not the police. Those agencies would of course receive the dollars from the amount that would be cut from the MPD budget. The reason I feel this way is because it is more of a moderate decision in this situation. I feel we need to stride from away from extreme pathways as they will inevitably be exploited from outsiders or opposers. Not only does this reasoning nake more sense in this situation, but it greatly applies to how Minnesota has handled COVID-19 and it is how our country needs to respond to things. This whole tragedy started here in Minneapolis and so I think the entire nation will be watching how we move forward from this. We have an opportunity to set an example of making the smart decision that is also the right decision, not just the popular one from each side. Thank you."

I am heartbroken for the injustice George Floyd suffered. I am furious at the rioting, looting, burning down of my immediate surrounding, all the grocery stores and all pharmacies and my family had to change pharmacies FIVE times to finally get my son's insulin!  The immediate food and medicine crisis my neighborhood suffers is devastating and still ongoing TODAY.  But for the police and the national guards, we would have suffered more burning and destruction. I am grateful for their law enforcement.  Instead of ""defund the police""', Minneapolis needs to increase funding for the police. The violence cannot be dealt with by just prevention. Increasing funding to police will help police do a better job with engaging the community, building trust, deescalating violent situations, and protecting people from harm.  So I do not agree wth your amendments.  If violence continues to increase and businesses feel unsafe and leave Minneapolis, there will be higher umemployment rate and higher crime rate and tax will increase for people who have jobs and pay taxes. In the end, people who are not protected and feel unsafe and are taxed heavily will simply quit Minneapolis and move to either suburbs or other cities, or worse, completely lose hope for Minnesota and move to other states.  So what happens next will decide how Minneaplis will fare, either sink or float.  You need to put a solid, feasible plan to make Minneapolis safer.

As someone who lives and works in Minneapolis, I love this city. And, as we've all seen over the last month, the city we love is in pain. In fact, living this city has always been painful for People of Color and Indigenous residents in Minneapolis since it's founding. That pain came to a boiling point with the murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department, and those of us who are white residents of the city could no longer ignore it.   The Minneapolis Police Department has shown time and again that they are beyond reform. No matter how much money we pour into the department and how much cultural training they have, the police department have shown contempt, hostility, and outright hatred to the community that they are supposed to serve. I know I do not feel comfortable calling the police in any situation for fear that they would escalate and turn a non-violent call into the death of yet another resident of this city. Residents of Minneapolis should be empowered to decide how we define safety and how we make our community safer. It shouldn't be left up to the police union and state legislature how we keep ourselves safe. Please allow the people of Minneapolis to vote on this Charter Amendment in the upcoming November election. The time for us to act is now. Thank you for your time."

They were never worthy of the public's trust, and it saddens me that so many innocent people had to suffer and die by the MPD's hand for this change to be considered. I fully support this amendment, and hope that it allows for a brighter, police-free future for our city."

However, I will say the lack of clarity around what will replace the MPD is weighing heavily on us and the decision to stay or leave Minneapolis when we need more space for our children. I would encourage the council to keep the police chief as a last measure of accountability and not decentralize things by ward. In some of the conversations I've been a part of this has been a topic of concern as there is no accountability when it is split 14 ways, where there would be if one person was ultimately responsible for most policing in the city.  Additionally, I would encourage the council to double down on policing along with measures like mental health and social work with whatever comes next.  Much has been made about Camden NJ and the success of their defund the police initiative, but it is interesting to know they actually employ more cops now than they did before. Thank you for your consideration!"

I don’t think establishing a brand new organIzation on such short notice is going to have the capabilities,  resources, and skills to handle what the current police department does.  My recommendation would be to convert police from generalists to specialists and have a triage system.  Some police can specialize in domestic disputes and social work for example while others specialize in rape or other types of violence.  When a 911 call comes in, it is triaged to the right specialist police department"

As a suburban resident I am called upon to attend to business in the city so this charter has direct implications on my safety and that of my family. The charter change removes staff levels allowing the council to understaff critical departments. The change does not mandate any role or duty that this new police force would be obligated to undertake nor require licensing of those officers. The new charter would allow employees without training or certification to be assigned to law enforcement duties. This means less likelihood that a responding person will know what the law is, what they can effect in a given situation, how to ensure that evidence is retained for prosecution. It is likely that this would decrease effective investigations and limit criminal justice. Without proper investigations, residents would not be able to seek relief from civil courts. The criminal justice system has been established with a uniform code of policing as its foundation. Minneapolis would be on its own and that doesn't work well for criminal justice. It would require Hennepin County and the State to demarc against this policy action so as to insulate themselves from the corresponding damages. Overall it is bad policy start to finish."

I agree with the innovation of having a community representative in between the mayor and police to provide appropriate priority and community engagement to policing.  I agree that its time to separate several aspects of social and health management from police responsibility  The police should not be expected to be a social service agency and they need significant reform to do enforcement in an unbiased and non-dangerous way.

The Council has shown that it is not able to give the mayor or Police Chief the ability to direct resources during times of immediate need and crisis.

Hiring hundreds of new peace officers and training them will take time, as will formulating new approaches to safety and violence prevention and procedures for peace officers. If we are going to get this right, we need to give the new department time to get ready, even if that means the police continue to exist for an extra six or 12 months.

I worry that the Division of Law Enforcement Services would continue to be funded at a high level (similar to the current MPD) and the health and community safety side of things would be underfunded, which I do not think should be the case. Violence is linked to poverty and basic needs not being met, so broad investments in public health (mental and physical), education, housing, access to healthy food, and other community resources is ESSENTIAL and should be a part of this department. I am very much in favor of this change, and hope that the Mayor and Council will continue to expand upon efforts to defund and reinvest / reform the way that things are currently done in a comprehensive way.

It is unprofessional of an elected official and is both demeaning and patronizing to everyone who was the target of said accusation. -Not every law enforcement officer is a Derek Chauvin and his fellow bystanding officers. -Peaceful protests are one thing.

Restorative justice should be part of the court system. Funds currently used for city council private security details should be allotted to new, separate department. -Enhanced accountability off all officers and transparency regarding disciplinary actions. -Social workers, psychologists, counselors, etc. reporting alongside police officers to assist in deescalating and diffusing situations.

I am a homeowner, small business owner and landlord all within the city of Minneapolis. When I first heard the City Council’s proposal after the murder of George Floyd I immediately started hearing from friends on social media telling me it was time to get out of Minneapolis, a thought which had already occurred to me. The mere possibility that we will be without a police department is absolutely frightening to me and all my neighbors (I have yet to find anyone that thinks this is a good idea), and a joyous occasion to criminals. Just look at what has been going on already even though we still have a police dept. The fact that the criminals know the police are not supported by the City Council has given them a license to do as they please. A friend of mine that is a pastor talked with a local store owner at the corner of 38th and Portland asking him how things have been. He indicated that business has been very slow and that he may not be able to continue, not because of the slow business but because young individual (he indicated young black men) simply walk into his store and steal food and other items and walk out. When he confronts them they tell him to, “f*** off! There is nothing the police will do about it.” Reform in our policing is absolutely necessary. But eliminating the police dept and replacing it with some form of social policing is insane. Just look at the situation at Powderhorn Park. A young girl was sexually molested but the people involved and the neighbors that came to help REFUSED to call the police. So this poor girl now has to live with her attacker in the encampment, if she is allowed to go back to her parent(s), as well as knowing none of the adults that should be protecting her did nothing to help her. How many people have been shot since the murder of George Floyd and how many more will be if the City Council has its way? My wife and I were in the process of a doing a $50k remodel/addition. Plans have been drawn up and we were looking into financing. This remodel will not happen if the City Council is allowed to change the City Charter. I don’t know how to measure this but I am certain our property values have already declined considerably. What family is going to want to move into a city with no police? What business is going to want to rebuild, let alone a new one move into a city with no police? We are now instead considering selling our home and moving out of the city. The only thing that keeps us from doing that is the belief that we may not get much for our home. This is what the City Council has done by boldly stating their desire to eliminate the police without any hint of a viable alternative. Council member Jeremiah Ellison stated that, “It would be disingenuous for us to engage with the public about what a new public safety system should look like knowing full well that we can’t implement those things because of the charter.” Really?? You don’t want to know what the public thinks?! Who are you serving?? Sounds to me like you are only serving yourselves if you think engaging the public on a change to the city charter is a waste of time."

"6/30/2020 2:08:43 PM",-12,"","","I am strongly opposed to the charter amendment being put forth by the Minneapolis City Council.  I have been a long time resident in Minneapolis and have lived in North Minneapolis since 1996. I have felt safe in my house and my neighborhood.  We as neighbors have worked hard to keep the drug dealers and the violence off of our street and we have been successful on the most part. We have each others phone numbers and each others backs.  But now as we witness the violence increasing at an alarming rate I say now is not the time to talk about dismantling the police. It's absurdly naive of the city council to think of appointing a non-law enforcement trained person in charge of Community Safety and Violence Services Supervisor for Licensed Police Officers and their Director i.e. Chief. Of course that  individual will be appointed by the City Council. The City council will have the final word on who this individual will be. No Thank You Add to that the fact of the glaring loophole of changing MUST maintain to MAY maintain when it comes to the wording for providing for a division of Law Enforcement Services. This is not well thought out and seems more like a knee jerk reaction to placate the masses and prove to us you are ""in touch"" with the people. These individuals on the City Council were elected by a small percentage of the licensed voters in the city of Minneapolis and that is shame on us, but to say they represent us is a half truth because they represent less than half of us.  I am 4th ward and our own City Council person was elected by 157 votes so not an overwhelming majority. Let's put this in perspective. This is too big an issue to be decided in a 4 paragraph amendment to our City Charter.  WE need the Police. Taking them away is not going to fix the problems in the streets they are making them worse. https://www.facebook.com/KSTPTV/videos/966586477111012  my neighborhood now.."
"6/30/2020 2:08:53 PM",-1,"","","I support the amendment. It is necessary to replace the unmanageable police department. I feel that the police department is primarily responsible for the extensive damage suffered by Minneapolis this year."
"6/30/2020 2:08:59 PM",-4,"","","Although, I believe most police officers are respectful of all Minneapolis residents, it is clear that a few have given the police department a negative reputation. For this reason, I believe that there may need to be greater oversight of police procedures, actions and training.  However, I strongly disagree with defunding or dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department. I believe such a move would be detrimental to the safety of all Minneapolis residents. If such a move is enacted, I believe the results will be negative and dangerous to all of Minneapolis."
"6/30/2020 2:09:13 PM",1,"","","The city council should no use the City Charter to change the police force.  Rather, the council needs to actually accept responsibity for the current situation and fix the issues itself.  We have to maintain a police force in our city -- we have too many issues related to guns, drugs etc. to not have one. The city council should re-do the bargaining agreement with the police department and then give the chief the ability to make changes as he sees fit.  I also suggest we require more education of our officers; that they live in the city and that pay be increased as the basis for extending the contract with the police union. I have watched Donald Trump ruin this country over the past 3+ years.  I don't wish to see the city council follow the same course."
"6/30/2020 2:09:45 PM",-9,"","","I fully support this proposal to place a question on the ballot this November about the establishment of a Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department. I just completed an MPH at the University of Minnesota and during my studies, I realized how much work we have to do to ensure we close educational and health equity gaps in our city and state. We must reinvest resources in education, affordable housing, healthcare, and so much more. This change allows us to reprioritize our commitment to racial equity in Minneapolis. We must preserve the sanctity of life. Right now, I am stuck in a trauma loop and experience dissociative flashbacks and nightmares after having the police throw tear gas, rubber bullets, flash grenades and more at me and my community. None of us should have to go to war over a potentially fraudulent $20 check when millionaires and billionaires continue to accumulate capital while the rest of us fight over scraps. The current social and cultural situation in this city and across this country is shameful. Junauda Petrus's poem about giving the police departments to the grandmothers resonates strongly with me right now. My paternal grandmother was raised in Baghdad, Iraq, and immigrated to the United States in the 1954. She sought refuge in Cincinnati, Ohio from the revolution occurring in Iraq. She raised four children there including my father. She was a stoic woman who was far from perfect, but she survived assimilation. She passed away several years ago. My maternal grandmother is also a survivor. Her twin sister tragically passed away in a car accident at age 16. My grandmother survived the abuse of my grandfather, an alcohol-dependent veteran who served in the Vietnam War. She also survived the tragic death of her second husband many years before I was born. My grandmothers live(d) full and painful lives, and like I said, neither are perfect, but neither would even think to point a gun at me or anyone who chose to stand up against a multi-generational legacy of police violence. We are all ready for change."
"6/30/2020 2:10:16 PM",-7,"","","As a longterm Minneapolis resident who would like very much to see deep and permanent change in the city's policing and public safety efforts, I am nonetheless appalled by the lazy and irresponsible  conduct of the City Council over the last month. Their only ability seems to be leaping to unwarranted conclusions in a single bound—without ever once leaving the echo chamber in which they seem to live. If they truly have a realistic vision of an alternative approach to public safety, they need to describe that vision in detail and test it thoroughly in conversation with all of the city's stakeholders. Vague slogans, cherry-picked hypotheticals and unsupported comparisons to other cities vastly different from our own do not count. Until they have done that hard work, they have no business requesting a change to the charter—let alone on an expedited schedule that suspends normal process. I strongly urge you to deny the council's request to place the proposed Charter amendment on the ballot this year."
"6/30/2020 2:10:50 PM",3,"","","Thank you for having the conviction to change something.

Please no the police department DOES NOT serve city the community equally nor has it been designed to do so from its inception. The department is overworked, undertrained and incapable of providing equitable services to BIPOC peoples across a multitude of issues. for these reasons the charter commission should establish a Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department."

No, I'm part Aboriginal so you can through that race stuff out the window.  When we head south, we can go to some other city instead.  I feel really bad for the community and George Floyd's death is tragic but to brand all law enforcement as bad is like saying all doctors are bad just because maybe one of them in their profession screwed up and killed someone - which has happened.  It happened to my mother-in-law..... How is it that your city councilors have private security?  Isn't that just police re-branded?  Seems that way.  Nothing makes sense anymore.

"6/30/2020 2:12:52 PM",39,"","",".PDF with my thoughts and comments on the proposed charter amendment attached! Thank you sincerely, for your time and consideration. Attachment: Dear Minneapolis Charter Commission, I care for my community; I care for my city. I care for my neighbors of all races, religions, sexual orientations; I care for them regardless of the uniform they do or don’t wear. Because I care about my neighbors and fellow citizens, I write to you, BEGGING you to please not approve the Minneapolis City Council’s amendment to the city charter, section 7.3. I believe reform needs to happen, and some of the goals of the City Council *should* happen, but they should in-tandem with our police department, not in place of it. Even if I felt that MPD should be entirely defunded/dismantled/abolished, I’d still know in my heart and mind that this process is being rushed, at best. They’ve decided to strikethrough 22 full lines of text of our charter, and replace those lines with barely more than half of the text; there’s no real clarity or guidance present in their amendment. Where the current charter section 7.3 clearly lays out how many employees per resident, the proposed amendment has no firm numbers, and the department could clearly be as few as a handful of people; I can’t say confidently that’s what the City Council is proposing, but they don’t clearly state that it’s NOT what they want—again, this amendment lacks clarity and definition, which should never be the case in *ANY* legislature, let alone that which is supposed to guide public safety. I want to believe that our City Council members are attempting to do what they think is best for the safety of our city, but this short, vague, rushed amendment signals that they don’t know what is best; honestly, that’s ok! We’re all trying to figure out what the best plan of action is, here. I, and many of my fellow neighbors in NE Minneapolis firmly believe that the best course of action is to pump the brakes, flesh out the idea(s), come up with a concrete/tangible game plan, and then put forward a vote. Disbanding our police department (especially with the massive uptick in violence over the last few weeks) and then figuring out what to do, is irresponsible at-best. Thank you sincerely for taking the time to read and consider my thoughts and comments on the proposed amendment, as you enter your review phase; it means the world. Sincerely"
"6/30/2020 2:12:59 PM",4,"","","As a black woman who has lived in Milwaukee and near Detroit, I do not believe we should change the city charter yet.  WHY SHOULD WE GIVE THE COUNCIL UNILATERAL POWER TO ABOLISH THE POLICE WHEN THEY (1) HAVE NEVER IMPLEMENTED REFORM TO THE ACTUAL POLICE UNI   ON CONTRACT, AND (2) DON’T HAVE AN ACTUAL PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN OR ALTERNATIVE?  Whether you want to reform, defund, or dismantle the police, the critical first step is for the Mayor and City Council to modify the police union contract with the city.  WHY?   The police union contract is a critical tool: (1) that the city can use NOW; (2) that the city has NEVER REALLY USED to address policing issues so the city doesn't know its power; (3) that tax payers already fund; and (4) the city can execute while implementing larger plans. (1)Fix the union contract and (2) come up with a new public safety model, THEN ask the public to change the charter so the public safety plan can be implemented."
"6/30/2020 2:13:14 PM",0,"","","Mpls. needs more law enforcement, not less. Translation...more educated cops on the beat. Just look at response times for proof."
"6/30/2020 2:13:16 PM",-3,"","","I am concerned about the implications this new system will have in terms of safety for our community members and families. Most concerning is the little transparency there has been as to what this new system would entail. I believe our county needs police reform but the current uptick in violence in our community and the lack of response from our elected officials has made us feel like we are left to fend for ourselves. I feel that I don't have a say in our safety and the future for our city."
"6/30/2020 2:13:38 PM",-5,"","","I believe the mandate of police departments most everywhere has been radically expanded, and Minneapolis is no exception. If budget for weapons and updated vehicles can be spent on wraparound services including nutrition for area students, rehabilitation of area blight, and other tested policy methods for avoiding crime all together, the results will be a happier populace at a lower cost. I am not blind to the truly discriminatory view the twin cities has had for many generations, but ultimately I believe everyone wants their neighbors to have a chance to participate as employees and customers and volunteers in the same community.  True trouble is always caused by a small fraction of people. That our police force views all members of the public with some degree of suspicion means we need something else. Culture change often cannot happen from within. You need to start with a new charter and a new belief in a worthwhile mission. Police departments serve a vital function in society. We should let them do that and take burdens of mental health treatment, food desserts, lack of economic opportunity and other features of inequality off their plates."
"6/30/2020 2:14:04 PM",10,"","","Dear charter commission, For your meeting on July 1, please consider your role in the democratic process. While you may or may not agree with the charter ammendment proposed by the City Council, I believe you should respect the right of the citizens to vote on the matter in a timely manner. Minneapolis is now in the international spotlight after another murder of a Black person by our police department. So the world is watching how we respond. In my opinion, we have the chance to envision and then do the hard work of fundamentally re-designiing public safety, given the history of racial and gender disparities. Your job now is to simply allow the process of municipal conversation, leading to a vote on Nov. 3, 2020. Thank you for your service to our city, Minneapolis resident"
"6/30/2020 2:14:19 PM",19,"","","I fully support the proposal to amend our city charter through a public referendum to create a department of public safety an removing the existing restrictive language specific to the police department.  This amendment, if approved, will provide the residents of Minneapolis and their elected leaders greater latitude in providing for the public safety of the residents, visitors and businesses of Minneapolis.  All cities must to evolve to meet the needs of the current day and the cities of the future require that the complex challenges arising from people living, playing, and working in community are addressed through holistic community-based solutions.  The existing charter language prohibits innovative, empathetic, cost-effective solutions from being introduced.  Please allow for a full vote by the residents of Minneapolis to determine our course.  This amendment is rooted in democracy, recommended by a unanimous vote of our elected city council representatives, and if approved by the voters, will represent the will of the people."
"6/30/2020 2:14:33 PM",31,"","","Background: 24 yo female, liberal, U of Iowa college graduate, bilingual, marched for BLM, volunteered to clean the community, and Hennepin Co Paramedic. The last title on the list is one of my most proud accomplishments: saying I am a Minneapolis paramedic. I moved here from Iowa to work for the best agency in the country with the best opportunity for me to learn and gain skills in emergency medical management, however I have gained much more than that already.  Being a Minneapolis Paramedic has given me a new prospective on life. I have saved people in every skin color, religion, sexual/gender identity, or ethnic background. I have walked the dangerous streets of shootings or gang violence or the most scary: the immediate riots after George Floyd’s tragic death, to save as many people as I could while trying to maintain safety myself. I think I have the coolest job in the world. I play lots of roles every day. Some days I am a therapist, some days I’m a surgeon, sometimes I deliver babies, sometimes I am a primary care provider, etc... but what will never change is my role as a patient advocate for ALL of my patients. Being a white female, I will never personally understand the injustices of racial discrimination, however, I am trying to. I see the aftermath of cold blooded racism just about every day. I use my voice as a white female and public servant to make sure all other voices are heard. I have stood up to other pedestrians, hospital staff, and yes, police officers when I have seen a patient mistreated. I am their advocate ALWAYS. I pride myself on my ability to de-escalate patients. I use compassion, empathy, genuine love, and learned techniques to talk patients out of committing suicide, I have calmed down violent drug users, and I have used science and medicine to safely calm the people down who cannot calm theirselves down in a medically safe way. In the latter part of the previous statement, I am referring to a term called Excited Delirium. While my de-escalation techniques are widely effective, some patients cannot be “directed”. People with this condition, in my professional experience, often cannot comprehend reality, simple commands, and that I am trying to resolve their MEDICAL EMERGENCY. Sometimes, patients have weapons, and as a paramedic, I am left vulnerable with only a calm and soothing voice as self defense. Some of these people need physical restraint via police so it is safe for me to calm their heart and blood pressure down so they don’t stroke. As much as I want to help everyone, I cannot help people if I get shot, stabbed, assaulted, kidnapped, etc., so having police by us to make sure our scene is “safe” is CRUCIAL. We as medics WILL NOT go to shooting scenes, belligerent drunks, overdoses, and domestic violence calls without a police officer being present before our arrival. I have personally been attacked by a patient who could not differentiate reality from his/her hallucinations, and police officers successfully saved my life.  My last point highlights the events after George Floyd’s death. Unfortunately, despite that paramedics are only here to heal and not hurt, we have no weapons, and we are patient advocates, we were somehow framed targets. The night Precinct 3 went up in flames was the worst night of my life. I had unending panic attacks as people threw rocks at my ambulance, they called me vulgar names, they made fake 911 calls to ambush our ambulances, as I was told to kill myself and that my children deserve to be raped, etc. The night was horrifying at best. Despite all this, I fulfilled another day of work in providing exceptional medical care to my community. If it wasn’t for the police officers making sure we could safely get to calls, there’s a high potential my patients and I wouldn’t be here today.  So many intelligent and genuinely good cops work in Minneapolis and I have the luxury of seeing them daily. Please protect the men and women who protect us."
"6/30/2020 2:15:14 PM",-12,"","","As long as every single council member is forced to move from their Ward and live in North Minneapolis among the absolute destruction and chaos they have caused and do not get private security I am all for it. This city council is inept and should be kicked to the curb right along with the MPD if this is their proposal. Day in and day out gun shots ring throughout our city with no recourse, prosecutors are culpable, the Mayor is culpable and all of the city council is culpable. Will anyone give a rats ass about the actual residents this hurts? NOPE. Just looking for headlines and PR Fluff ... "" The council is a joke. The city of Minneapolis a joke. The boy Mayor is a joke. Hennepin County Sheriff is a coward and so are Freeman and all of the local governments. Do something meaningful instead of 'hopes and dreams'.

"6/30/2020 2:15:59 PM",-8,"","","I support the charter amendment. I’ve lived in Minneapolis since 1999. The MPD doesn’t make us safer. We effectively don’t have a number to call in an emergency, without worrying that the situation would become more dangerous. We need an alternative we can trust won’t be so quick to use violence as we saw with George Floyd, Justine Damond, and Jamar Clark among others. In the most recent case of George Floyd, the MPD officers killed a man and then the department lied about it. It showed no commitment to public safety, while MPD consuming more than $190million of our public safety budget. This amendment is the correct next step. We need something new, a paradigm shift toward violence prevention."
"6/30/2020 2:16:08 PM",-20,"","","Chief Arradondo is great, and don't want to see him replaced.  I have personally seen police be rude and unnecessarily rough with young black kids on Lake St.  I am totally in favor of protests and Black Lives Matter.  I have been in a mixed raced marriage for more than 30 years, so have heard MANY stories of police brutality from those that experienced it.  So many things have to be fixed, and there are many of those that will take a long time.  Please read Lisa Clemons' posted letter.  She was an officer for 13 years with MPD. Here it is: IF I CAN Be HONEST...AS I ALWAYS AM. I never care about who gets pissed at me for telling the TRUTH. I was a Minneapolis Police Officer for 13 years. I PROUDLY wore that uniform. There will be no cops standing up to say racism does not exist in MPD. In TRUTH no person in any job will say that. If they do, they are a liar...Plain and simple.  I sued MPD 2 times, as a police officer and I won...It never made me not want to wear my uniform. Chief Arradondo and 5 other males sued MPD and won. It never made them want to stop wearing the uniform. It made us spend even more time talking to cops about change. It was not until Chief Arradondo became the Chief and DC Arthur Lee Knight became the Deputy Chief did I start to believe in change. THIS CHIEF has fired and demoted more cops than any of his predecessors. Chief Arradondo would NEVER offer up that information, because he is a man of character and it’s nothing to brag about... It happens when you are making REAL change. NEVER have a I seen a chief who has strong relationship with EVERY COMMUNITY and is inclusive of ALL people. NEVER have I seen a Chief pick up a phone and call Boots on the Ground organizations and Clergy to say I NEED YOU in an area of the City. I don't want to dispatch police officers unless you say you need one. NEVER have I seen a Chief make a policy that allows him to IMMEDIATELY fire an officer..... Something other Cities are already looking to copy. NEVER have I seen a Chief beat up so badly by a City Council from the first day he accepted his appointment....and they do it PUBLICLY. Never has a Chief been asked to change 150 years of a culture in 3 years with no support from anyone but the community....Knowing a City Council is waiting in the wings for any errors to pounce on you and finding ways to cripple you by asking you to do mor with less. In the last budget Cycle a few on the council asked an organization come in and ask that $1 million dollars be divested from MPD to be given to organizations in the community. I asked why they wouldn’t take 1% from EVERY department under the City. Of course they went silent. But IF THEY HAD here is that breakdown:  1% of city budget: approximately $18 million 1% of city departments: Best guess is between $9-15 million 1% of MPD: approximately $1.5 million The community got the short end of the stick because that $1 Million didn’t really come to the community....Poli-tricks! Since 2000 I have been working in the community, predominantly in North Minneapolis because that's where I grew up when we moved to the Great City of Minneapolis. Where I PROUDLY graduated from North High school and where I was blessed to work as a Patrol Officer and as a Street Sergeant. In fact, both Chief Arradondo and DC Knight worked for me when I ran a team out of Minneapolis Public Housing. I hand-picked my officers who were ALL BLACK and one White. I was the first training officer of DC Knight... Both of whom came from single Black poor mothers in Chicago. Over the last 6 years I have been STRICTLY Boots on the Ground in North Minneapolis and Downtown... and sometimes in South Minneapolis.  My team, A Mothers Love, was formed to help the City realize that Saving the Black Mother WILL SAVE the Black child. The Black mother has ALWAYS been the group not brought to the table so our voices were never heard. The first person to call on us was the Minneapolis Police Department and since we have been working closely with great people in all communities. WHY did the Deputy Chief call us? Because Black Police Officers know WHO the Black man, Black son, Black nephew, Black Grandson, etc has a strong love and respect for. In the good and bad,,,,,They love and respect us...Because Black female officers are great at de-escalation because majority of us came from the life many are living. I can tell you with 100% Truth: The Minneapolis City Council has put no real time in weighing the danger of dismantling/abolishing the police. THIS, no matter what perfume they spray on it, will get people killed, even more in MY COMMUNITY. They like to say that my point of view is a scare tactic...hmmmm and you telling someone calling for help makes you a White Supremacist. If a Black wants to call what would be the name for them? I don’t do politics so I’ll never put a vote before a life. I don’t have an agenda. As it stands, there are MANY Boots On The Ground Organizations out here doing GREAT work but the TRUTH has to be told. WE have lost control of what is happening in the community. Many of US have not given up, nor will we. Like the police we run from call to call to call. The shootings, Homicides and other crimes absolutely drain you, but we keep going. I felt the same way when I was wearing BLUE. One would only have to listen to a scanner for 24 hours to know the TRUTH. Selling people UTOPIA when you have no plan for all the other dangers and issues in a City the size of Minneapolis is INSANE. When Minneapolis decided to go even bigger as a City, they opened the door for more Crime, including Sex Trafficking.... To now say we don’t need the police is simply crazy. If they are going to have a year long conversation why are they seeking to change the charter before those conversation even start...PLEASE open your eyes to this vote me back in in 2021 game. When I say the City Council is dangling a shiny object in front of people eyes I mean that....MPD is the EASY Button and the only thing on their agenda. EVERY PUBLIC SAFETY MEETING has been focused on the police and NEVER the escalating violence in the community...Now City Wide This is a City that still can't find housing for our most vulnerable. A City that when I BEGGED them to help us address the issues on Broadway/Lyndale last Summer NO ONE would call me back.... But when those vulnerable drug addicted people were mowed down in the Bus shelter RACISM is what they screamed....But they still NEVER came to give us any help nor any resources. We had soooooo many overdoses on that corner and still no help. If it's racism that nearly killed them when the White male driver mowed them down, what do we call it when OUR OWN are on that corner EVERYDAY feeding them the dope that causes those over doses? The price of doing business? We don't want the police saying anything to these people LOITERING with INTENT to kill with Drugs.... MOST OF YOU are too afraid to even approach....... How would you do that in the City Councils UTOPIA? Remember, Adults can refuse to go to treatment...Hence all the addicts in the parks that I pray for EVERY DAY. A few years ago, I attended several meetings between Hennepin County and Ramsey County about a joint YOUTH Treatment facility, to be built between the 2 cities, so that families could be part of the treatment process. I thought YES finally someone understands WE and other communities have a drug problem with our kids....Of course a group came in to shut down the idea saying, 'Our kids don't have a drug problem. This is just another pipeline to prison."" I was in ABSOLUTE SHOCK. There is NO DOUBT we have a drug problem with our youth...IN ALL DAMN COMMUNITIES. I stood up and said, ""Are you kidding!!! We ABSOLUTELY have a drug and alcohol problem in our community. If you think these young people are pulling these triggers sober then I am even more afraid."" I believed the facility should have been built with US being part of it every step of the way. It should have been Culturally Competent and the programs should have been designed by US to ensure our kids and their family’s needs are met. After one more meeting at the Minneapolis Urban League, with the same group shutting it down, Hennepin County and Ramsey County pulled and we continue to deal with drug overdoses and deaths of our young people and our girls strung out and being sex trafficked....EVERY ACTION is knee-jerked with no other plan or option and the loudest mouths sets the rules...... Because people let them. While I believe all voices should be heard....Is that what’s happening in Minneapolis or is the Council seeking like thinkers and exploiting them for their own personal agendas. Perhaps it might be too late when people really figure it out. In TRUTH, I and MANY others, lived through Murderapolis. I wore BLUE at the time and the REAL TRUTH is we worked strong with Black Pastors, the community as a whole, organizations throughout the City, Neighborhood Associations and retired gang members to bring the City back in control. EVERYBODY worked as a team.... No one saw color of skin nor the color of your clothes. That was when Minneapolis understood the term ALL HANDS ON DECK. I stand STRONG on the need for Police Reform but I stand equally strong on the need for Community Reform. EMAIL THE CHARTER COMMISSION AND ASK QUESTION... I'll attach their email info. Ask yourself WHY the Council is in a rush without a plan... before the ""yearlong conversations"". WHY they have addressed the MEDIA more than the voters....PAUSE AND THINK My mom will be 84 years old in July and she lives in Ward 4, as do my oldest sister. My mom is on edge about this and I KNOW I will go protect her AT ALL COST"
"6/30/2020 2:16:20 PM",-14,"","","I fully support the charter amendment proposed by the City Council. This city has seen too many of its Black residents harmed, humiliated, put into an unending cycle of fear and mistrust, profiled and ultimately killed by the Minneapolis Police department. It’s time the city learns from its past and focuses on ending its racist systems to build a better future with opportunities for ALL. The police department was put in place to control marginalized communities through intimidation and brute force. It’s time to say that was wrong and let’s make a change. I think of my 4 year old son. He understands fairness and kindness. I had to explain to him how 4 police officers lynched a black man in public because of the color of his skin and how this city didn’t respond until the community let out a cry of righteous anger. I want him to grow up in a society that stands up to systemic racism.  My family wants to be on the right of history.

They keep referring to the example of Camden, NJ, but the difference in population size does not make this a fair comparison. I am for changes within the dept. as discussed by Mayor Jacob Frey and Chief Arrandondo, (whom we are very lucky to have leading our force!) , but by no means do i feel Minneapolis should be a city without a police force. We are all upset by the fact that three of the city council now are using our tax money for their private security, and yet suggesting we go without. I am against changing the Minneapolis city charter, as suggested by the Mpls City Council.  Thank you."

There will still need to be law enforcement services to provide a safe environment in the city. This proposed amendment does not guarantee any law enforcement services will be available unless the council deems it so.  The city council needs to do better than this for our residents. The current police department needs severe changes, however eliminating it completely is not in the best interest of the safety of our residents.  Does there need to be more funding toward public safety and community violence?  Yes.  Will moving all our funding to these initiatives prevent violence and the need for law enforcement?  Absolutely not.  We still need people that are trained to handle these situations.  There is still a lot that can be done to invoke positive change in our city and not eliminate law enforcement in the process."

We've already seen an uptick in crime when people perceive that there is a decreased police presence, even that hasn't even happened yet. We absolutely still need ample funding for our police department to ensure there is stability in our community while these new programs are put into effect. The slogan ""defund the police"" is incredibly misleading and will hurt public support as it incites fear of lawlessness. We need to be absolutely clear that there will still be a police department, with enough funding to successfully receive proper training while performing their necessary duties, while still redirecting a portion of their funds towards community outreach programs. This needs to be done carefully as we cannot let less police funding lead to a stretched police force that cannot properly ensure the safety of our community."

I am fully aware of the criminal record of George Floyd and his threatening to kill a pregnant woman’s unborn baby, and though Mr. Floyd under no circumstances deserved to be murdered by a psychotic police officer, this does not give anyone the right to determine that our lives as the tax paying citizens in this city are not valuable, yet we must pay for private security for these council members. My council member has been informed of the action I intend on taking the minute I learn that anything has happened to this Police Department.  I find the council members a hell of a lot more dangerous to our safety than I do the Police Department.   Case in point, unless you purchase a bias newspaper bought and paid for by liberals, citizens were not made aware of this grandstand play behind the citizens back of removing their rights to vote on this decision.   No surprise there.  I WILL NOT BE THREATENED with the likes of any one of those self -righteous morons. Like Cuomo, you are placing the senior citizens in this city in jeopardy without even batting an eyelash or gi  ving them the opportunity to defend their needs.    I am hereby telling you as a citizen of the City of Minneapolis since 1957, that if you defund and disband the police department you shall also defund and disband the City Council.

The police (or whatever that role will be called) cannot have responsibility to 14 people. That structure will NOT work. I do not support the way this happened nor do I support the vagueness of the amendment.

I do think that we will need to figure out how things are going to be taken care of for mental health calls if PD isn't arriving first to clear the scene for HCMC, but that is something that we can figure out as we go. I think that a joint effort between HCMC and county social services would be a good way to do it, using a team of one paramedic and one social worker to evaluate calls as they come in and request and ambulance or otherwise problem solve from there. We need two people that have mental health, medical, and some self defense training to problem solve and keep each other safe."

I live in the 3rd Precinct, and it was my local post office, grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants and community organization buildings that were burned down and damaged in the riots.  This has been heartbreaking and stressful, to lose so many cornerstones of my local community.  But not anywhere comparable to the heartbreak and anxiety of living in a city where our citizens fear the police department as much as any criminal elements because of decades of police abuse, unaccountability, disconnection from our communities, lack of transparency, violence, militarization, and arrogance.  We have tried training, we have tried body cams, - these small, incremental attempts at reform that have clearly not succeeded in making our city safer or more peaceful.  I 100% support the amendment to the city charter, in order to allow us to create meaningful, structural change to the ways we protect and serve our communities. As horrific and heartbreaking as the events of the past month have been, I am incredibly proud of Minneapolis and our City Council members for being brave enough and clear headed enough to recognize that old attempts to solve these problems have failed and that a deep systemic change is needed for our city and our country to heal from these deep wounds.

The issues of gun violence, sexual assault, and drug trafficking are enormous in our city, and their plan does not take into consideration the safety issues that we all face in the city. I believe that radical reform of the police is necessary so that the violence against African Americans in Minneapolis will finally stop. However, the City Council has not created an appropriate way for this to be addressed. This amendment will only cause divisiveness, while furthering the political aspirations of the City Council members, and it will have a destructive impact on the city.

I care for my neighbors of all races, religions, sexual orientations; I care for them regardless of the uniform they do or don’t wear.   Because I care about my neighbors and fellow citizens, I write to you, BEGGING you to please not approve the Minneapolis City Council’s amendment to the city charter, section 7.3.  I believe reform needs to happen, and some of the goals of the City Council *should* happen, but they should in-tandem with our police department, not in place of it.   Even if I felt that MPD should be entirely defunded/dismantled/abolished, I’d still know in my heart and mind that this process is being rushed, at best.  They’ve decided to strikethrough 22 full lines of text of our charter, and replace those lines with barely more than half of the text; there’s no real clarity or guidance present in their amendment.  Where the current charter section 7.3 clearly lays out how many employees per resident, the proposed amendment has no firm numbers, and the department could clearly be as few as a handful of people; I can’t say confidently that’s what the City Council is proposing, but they don’t clearly state that it’s NOT what they want—again, this amendment lacks clarity and definition, which should never be the case in *ANY* legislature, let alone that which is supposed to guide public safety. I want to believe that our City Council members are attempting to do what they think is best for the safety of our city, but this short, vague, rushed amendment signals that they don’t know what is best; honestly, that’s ok!  We’re all trying to figure out what the best plan of action is, here.  I, and many of my fellow neighbors in NE Minneapolis firmly believe that the best course of action is to pump the brakes, flesh out the idea(s), come up with a concrete/tangible game plan, and then put forward a vote.  Disbanding our police department (especially with the massive uptick in violence over the last few weeks) and then figuring out what to do, is irresponsible at-best. Thank you sincerely for taking the time to read and consider my thoughts and comments on the proposed amendment, as you enter your review phase; it means the world."

I feel we need more police officers. When I drive down Nicollet Mall and there are 15 to 20 drug dealers and byers at all of the main stops You can really see how out of control this city is. All you have to do is park a police vehicle there and the crime drops by 80%. Granted it probably just goes to another area. The idea of having more mental health workers and drug counselors is a very nice and warm and fuzzy idea. However the money that you need to follow through and help these people Is not there. You will need a massive amount of money to build the infrastructure to deal with the mentally ill, homeless, drug addicted people, chronic alcoholics and more.  When I have issues on my bus, nothing at all happens to the people who are threatening fellow passengers or myself. When I talk to the police about it, they say that there is zero support on the side of the city for doing anything about Z‘s violent people. The city has created this mess by being lax in so many areas! If we actually prosecuted and did not slap hands and let people walk away, this city would be so much better. If the city stepped up prosecuting these offenders, it would actually have the ability to focus on the mentally Ill and displaced people appropriately.   I talk and work with the police on a daily basis and I am 100% convinced that many people making these decisions About defunding the department and shifting focus and balance have no clue what is really happening on the streets because they’re not riding my bus at 1 AM.

"6/30/2020 2:33:56 PM",-8,"","","The proposed charter amendment articulates that the council ""may"" be able to maintain a division of law enforcement services, but does not require them to. This is too vague. This language gives me misgivings since it is not clear that the City Council has plans to form a force that could respond to active violent crimes, particularly gun violence sprees that we are seeing spike currently.  I agree that investing in public safety outside of utilizing officers is incredibly important. However the current language of the charter amendment leaves open this question of whether or not officers will play a role. I think in its current vague form, it will not garner sufficient support on a ballot measure, even from those who would otherwise support reinvesting policing money into public safety, but are terrified of gun violence.  The current language leaves the charter amendment under attack from people who say 'who will respond to someone with a gun breaking into your house? A social worker?' and so the language of the amendment must make plain whether or not officers will be part of the department.  In order for me to support such an amendment to the charter, I would need a clearer framework for what the council actually plans to do.  I understand the council plans to do community outreach to build a new department of public safety. But the fact that a charter amendment vote would come before that process is finished leaves me uncertain of my support. Voting to approve such an amendment without knowing what their plan is would be a leap of faith in the Council; if the vote was tomorrow to change the charter, I have no idea what I would vote."

Not with social work. Focus on the kids who are at the cusp of making really bad decisions. Kids keep dying because their parents make bad decisions and the kids end up collateral damage. Teen moms should be forced to do parenting classes. You cant expect a child who was never taught anything worth a darn to turn around and raise her child right. Its a vicious cycle that noone wants to talk about. Young male teens who keep fathering multiple babies and do nothing for them, need to be given a choice, you do father classes or u suffer severe consequences. Child support threats dont work. They just incentivized to make money illegally that they dont pay taxes on therefore no childsppt paid."

Before you ask to change the City Charter, lets see a plan for improving, not disbanding the Police Dept.  Weed out the bad (got a plan?); examine your hiring practices and criteria (got a plan?); protect the good cops from bad cops (got a plan?); protect ALL the people of Minneapolis (got a plan?)  Let's spend less time worrying about masks and social distancing and find some leadership to deal with the problems the City Council keeps blaming others for.  CC and Mayor did nothing when the rioting, looting and burning started.  Nero, at least played his violin when Rome burned.  If the mayor and CC are afraid of the police union or are not strong enough to deal with them, defunding MPD is NOT the answer.  Let's defund the weak, elected leadership and replace them with courageous people with conviction and desire to protect all the citizens of Minneapolis.

I think the officers need to be more engaged with and invested in the community. I think we need to look to other large cities that have had issues with the police and see what they have done.

I'm open to reform by increasing their training funds and increasing the bar we set for individuals to become police officers.   I don't understand the statistical basis for dismantling/abolishing/defunding the Minneapolis police department.  Supposedly,  YouGov polls have only one group that agrees with defunding the police - left-liberals (not blacks, not minorities, not university students, the list goes on & on).  If this is true, then why are we voting for an agenda that the majority of people do not support?  I think we have grouped police officers and placed a pang of guilt upon their shoulders.  This is dehumanizing and is exactly what happened in the soviet union.  Look at the Kulaks, a group of peasants who rose up to be great farmers.  The Soviets acknowledged them as a group and placed guilt upon their shoulders for ""gathering their wealth by plundering those around them"".  They abolished 2 million of them to Siberia (a death sentence) and in the 1930's we consequently saw 6 million Ukrainian people starve to death.  I am not arguing that this will happen, but I am suggesting that what is being done neglects the dignity of the human person.  You cannot place the sins of one man upon the entirety of a group without concrete statistical evidence, nor can you perceive the negative effects that will surface when you abolish a pivotal department in society."
"6/30/2020 2:46:56 PM",20,"","","Hello city council, I support your decision to defund the police and replace it with another public safety department. The toll the police department has taken on our black and brown communities is unjust and I am proud that we are taking a stance against systematic racism in this way.  I do hope however that the council will understand that change doesn't happen over night, and I hope the dispersement of funds away from the police will happen over a long period of time. While I know the true solution is to invest more in our communities, making sure they have education, food, housing and economic security. I also know crime will never completely go away.  That's why I hope we can develop a system that still keeps us all safe, while eliminating the racism we have seen from this institution.  I would also like to say that I believe the language we are using is polarizing and I would like to see it change. I believe that defund the police only divides us further from people who may be on our side if the issue was explained and talked about in a different way. There are ways to talk about this that will demonstrate that the world could be better for both our black and brown communities AND those who serve our community (like cops). For example, explaining defund the police as a way to provide more training and specialization to those who protect us, so that they can be safer and more equipped to handle difficult situations. I support this policy and hope that Minneapolis will consider changing the narrative on what community safety can be, to include both the safety of our public servants AND our communities."

The police union has fought them at every turn, keeping officers on the job who should have been charged with crimes or at the very least, dismissed without pensions. The city pays out millions in taxpayer dollars every year to settle wrongful deaths and police brutality cases and now we, as a city, are the focus of negative international attention because once again an officer with a documented record of brutality was allowed to continue in his job until he murdered an innocent man in front of numerous witnesses. This is not a police force that can possibly be reformed in its current structure and we as city residents, we need to reckon with this.

All in the name of getting re-elected. The major problems still exist in North Minneapolis, South Minneapolis and has, for the last decade or so, migrated to destroy our downtown and uptown too. One week after your very political and very much publicized 'De-fund the Police' effort, over 100 shootings and a few stabbings occurred. That blood is on your hands. Congratulations - now you have minorities killing each other openly -you must be so proud. You people are idiots. 'Make America a Shithole Again... Keep Voting Democratic.' Look around... Detroit, NY, Chicago, LA and Minneapolis are all proud Democratic strongholds with legacies of crime, lack of affordable housing, and poor schools (Minneapolis being the WORST in the nation) and a history of continued issues plaguing these communities.  If you abandon the police department, those of us who work hard, keep nice neighborhoods, and pay taxes will abandon your self-created shit-hole. You continue to ""Gentrify"" neighborhoods, then wonder why you have no affordable housing. You continue to let the teachers union provide zero accountability and suppress school choice, denying minority and under-represented communities their children's opportunity for a better education to get them out of the shit-hole you created and still can't fix. How sad. How terribly, terribly sad. Perhaps minorities will wake up to the Oppression, Dependence and Decimation the Democrats have brought them for 50 years.

However, I have some questions about said amendment: -Originally, the charter states we need ""0.0017"" police for each resident.  How many new employees will be allotted to the city in each category (community safety, violence prevention, and law enforcement)? -How does the amendment to the charter effect the police force in terms of detectives, and other law enforcement personnel who are not necessarily the ones we think of as regular ""cops?"" -Who are you working with in the community to help you write these charter amendments? -Can incentives be offered for these new personnel to live in the city which they serve? -What kind of mandatory training will the reimagined peace officers need to graduate from in order to serve our city equitably and effectively? I look forward to learning more."

"6/30/2020 2:57:23 PM",-26,"","","I have so many questions on what this means for how the city responds to crime. I understand and support fully investing money into crime prevention as opposed to response, but I think we also have to recognize that crime will always be present in society. How will the new department respond to situations such as your house being broken into, a car or property being stolen, rape and sexual assault taking place, mugging, carjacking, etc? Will citizens need to know what branch of the department to reach out to for immediate help, or will 911 dispatchers? And in those situations of immediate danger, how will the physical response under the new department differ from more traditional policing? Another comment I have is the thought of sending mental health professional to respond to situations. I very much like this idea. But practically speaking, I fear many times we don't know it's a mental health issue until someone responds to the scene - a caller to 911 will likely be unable to make that determination, nor do I think it would be fair to place the responsibility for deciding that onto the caller. So, do we always send a mental health professional first, and then if turns out that is wrong then send a peace officer? Or do we send a peace officer first? Or does the 911 dispatcher have to make that call without being on the scene? How will the new department make that assessment? Last, what role do gun laws plays into this? America is sadly an armed society. The studies from England I have seen referenced about police without guns being a success work in England because such a low percentage of the population own guns, but the landscape is vastly different here. What does the department think about an armed population, and in turn instances of armed criminals, being monitored by potentially unarmed peace officers? Less guns is always safer, but if that conversation is not happening at the federal level do we put safety at risk? We need so many more details on the practical implications on what this all means, and specifically 1) how that changes our interaction with the city when we are victims of crime, 2) how the changes will curb the spread of racism, and 3) how the new department will prevent another police killing."

Even as our rate of crime continued to fall, the MPD continues to eat up a larger and larger share of our resources, move toward increased militarization, move toward a ""killology"" approach to policing, and reject any oversight. We desperately need to put these resources toward actual solutions, toward programs that address the root causes of crime, toward approaches to public safety that do not rely on a highly armed army treating our city as a war zone, and one in which minorities and the disabled are frequently targeted and victimized by the people who are supposed to protect them."

We certainly do not need an escalating civil war sparked by agitators (red or blue), or opportunistic troublemakers aware that no one is going to stand in their way or come to stop them.  With that in mind, I believe that the Commissioners should vote 'NO"" to changing the city charter at this time.   While I am white and live Uptown, I am in agreement with the reasons listed below for not dismantling the police in this way at this time.  These reasons were written by an African American woman living on the North side. MORE ON WHY THEY SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE CHARTER NOW: 1. AGAIN, There is no plan to replace the current police department 2. A disproportionately white population of folks who don't live in North Minneapolis, (and never would) and non-Northsiders are behind dismantling the police. Most African American folks I know demand that the police radically transform by any means necessary, but we don't want announcements about getting rid of the police now. Our children are being shot and killed on our streets. Protecting them is our #1 priority– Not politics! 3. The City Council's announcement that it plans on dismantling the police is immature, premature and dangerous. We are in the middle of the greatest crime and violence spree in our neighborhood since 1996 when Mpls was dubbed 'Murderapolis.' Now is not the time to tell those committing unchecked violence daily that we are getting rid of the police. This has become a license to kill and shoot. 4. Under the new charter the new 'department of safety,' would report to 14- Council people who are responsible for different parts of the city that have different needs. Currently the police are held accountable by the Mayor and Police Chief. 14 bosses are too much! 5. We haven't fully supported, nor given a real chance, to the first African American police chief, Arradondo. He has already stepped up and refused to negotiate with the police union– something which no other chief has done before. 6. The timing on this is just bad. Let's get a plan and possibly put something on the ballot next year. Not now."
"6/30/2020 2:59:49 PM",-13,"","","Please, the answer is not to amend the charter and/or dismantle the police. We need more officers with better training, not less! Just a few weeks ago over 1000 buildings were burned, destroyed, and badly damaged in Minneapolis. This happened because there were not enough officers to stop it. What will happen if you get rid of the police? How many will he murdered? How many people's homesand livelihoods destroyed? Residents of Minneapolis, myself and my family included will flee the city. Business will close and go elsewhere. There will be no tourism, no conventions, the city will go broke and crumble. Please think about this logically and stop pushing for a vote in November. It is not the answer!"
"6/30/2020 2:59:55 PM",3,"","","I live in Eagan and visit MPLS regularly. If the city goes through with defunding, replacing or eliminating the police, I WILL NOT SET FOOT IN THE CITY EVER AGAIN! Wake up and do the right thing. Increase funding for training and more officers. If not, your beautiful city will be no more."
"6/30/2020 3:00:08 PM",-4,"","","With violent crime on the rise I won't be voting for anything this half baked.  Before this year I had no idea who was on city council. Though I respect that they got elected, I don't believe these bottom of the ballot small frys represent the majority of residents."
"6/30/2020 3:00:27 PM",-3,"","","I would not vote for a charter change when the city council can not tell the citizens what the plan actually is.  Will there be a police dept.?  How many police officers?  How will incidents of violence be handles?  Who investigates robberies, shootings, etc.? And isn't it ironic that the city is paying for licensed, armed security for 3 council members, because they are afraid for their safety.  How can they maintain, with a straight face, that the citizens do not need to have that same sense of personal safety?"
"6/30/2020 3:00:44 PM",-9,"","","I support removal of the Minneapolis Police Dept from the charter and replace it with a new Community Safety & Violence Prevention Department. For too long Bob Kroll has fomented a cruel culture of unfettered aggression & brutality within the police union, toward BIPOC persons of Minneapolis. Kroll has tripled-down on statements he made calling Black Lives Matter a “terrorist organization” and believes that if police officers are “in this job and you’ve seen too much blood and gore and dead people then you’ve signed up for the wrong job.” Minneapolis does not need a department that chose as it’s union leader someone who minimizes & scoffs at the influx of PTSD among officers involved in armed confrontations and would actually prefer to have officers de-sensitized to “blood and gore and dead people.” We owe it to every neighborhood in this city to do better, to rebuild trust and create services that address the real gaps in community services & constructively problem-solve these issues to which the police force has shown they are professionally out of their depth to respond."
"6/30/2020 3:00:48 PM",11,"","","I am so happy the City of Minneapolis is moving in this visionary direction. Please continue to keep a police presence out of all threads involving protecting and serving Minneapolis. Stay vigilant. Black lives matter."
"6/30/2020 3:00:52 PM",3,"","","I support this amendment moving forward to be voted on in 2020. Let the citizens of Minneapolis have the final say in this matter."
"6/30/2020 3:01:56 PM",-5,"","","Please do not disband the police department. We need them or there will be anarchy. Find strategies they can employ, more mental health and drug training, have them read books to address racism. We need more officers, not less. I understand that you all feel bad, but we have to make efficient change."
"6/30/2020 3:02:17 PM",8,"","","I urge that the charter commission approve the proposed amendment for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the Minneapolis Police Department has shown a track record of abuse towards those it is supposed to protect and serve, and this pattern of violence affecting our Black citizens specifically is toxic and resistant to attempts at reform. The trust of the community has been broken and advancing this amendment would serve as an important first step towards restorative justice and reconciliation in Minneapolis, allowing us to create a safer, more prosperous city for all living here.  Secondly, the police department is the only city department that does not report to the city council. As we have seen this arrangement does not work and should not continue. There is no reason for the Police to bypass city council and go straight to the mayor.  Thirdly, and most importantly for the unelected charter commissioners to remember is that this is about what the people want. It is not your place as an appointed, not elected member of the commission to censure justice and knock down amendments created in the service of justice by the people's representatives. Regardless of what you may think of the merits of the proposed amendment, I ask that you please advance it, knowing that it will not immediately go into effect and will need to be ratified by voters. That alone should be enough for you to advance it. If a majority of residents want this change, why should you get to stop it just because you agree? Let it play out at the ballot box, not on the floor of the unelected charter commission."
"6/30/2020 3:02:41 PM",-2,"","","Im against the proposed amendment that wants to remove the Police Department and establish a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department."
"6/30/2020 3:02:44 PM",-18,"","","While I am firmly of the belief that the MPD requires major reforms to eradicate racism and brutal methodologies, I do not condone the charter commission as it is written. A division of law enforcement (whether called by the name police or otherwise) is needed to keep bad actors in check.  In particular I have a problem with the word ""MAY"" in the following statement: (b) Division of Law Enforcement Services. The Council may maintain a division of law enforcement services, composed of licensed peace officers, subject to the supervision of the department of community safety and violence prevention. This simultaneously leaves citizens of Minneapolis unprotected and allows for the creation of an agency with no particular accountability. A more targeted reform is necessary to increase the accountability of police officers. Police officers must be trained in de-escalation tactics. They must be required to report use of excessive force. Officers reported using excessive force must be fired. Additionally, We need service providers other than the police to help with problems related to homelessness, substance abuse, and other social problems. Such reforms do not require the abolition of a police force. Or, if the police force is abolished, it should not leave a law enforcement void.  Do we need to keep the Minneapolis Police Department as it stands today? No. Do we need to keep a department called ""Police""? No. However, we need a law enforcement body that is properly trained to serve and protect the community."
"6/30/2020 3:03:19 PM",-3,"","","We ask that the Charter Commission REJECT the proposed Charter Amendment regarding removal of the Police Department. The City Council has proposed to “commence a year long process of community engagement, research, and structural change to create a transformative new model for cultivating safety in our city.”   That engagement and research needs to be done BEFORE a Charter Amendment is written and submitted to the Commission, let alone voted on by the citizens.  The City Council is acting recklessly and irresponsibly in regard to public safety."
"6/30/2020 3:03:22 PM",-8,"","","Without a fully-funded, well-trained, and authority-given police force, I and my family will no longer visit the City of Minneapolis. If you are not going to protect all citizens from the crime that is now running rampant, we will make the decision to not visit the City of Minneapolis. We will not stay in a hotel the City of Minneapolis. We will not buy meals in the City of Minneapolis. We will not attend concerts in the City of Minneapolis. We will not attend a Minnesota Twins game in the City of Minneapolis. We will not attend a Minnesota Vikings game in the City of Minneapolis. We will not attend a Minnesota Timberwolves or Lynx game in the City of Minneapolis. We will not attend a Minnesota Gophers Football, Basketball, Hockey, or other university sport in the City of Minneapolis. We will no longer attend shows at Guthrie Theatre. The only people who want less law enforcement are those who run afoul of the law or do not want to be subject to the law. The short-sighted ignorance and putrid pandering of the Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey has set back the City of Minneapolis decades, from which it may not ever return, and certainly will not return until diversity of thought returns to the Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Jacob Frey."
"6/30/2020 3:03:28 PM",-5,"","","Removing the Minneapolis police department would be one of the worst things that the city could do. I do not support this amendment. You are inviting Mayham into our city, and it would propel me to leave. Taking my tax dollars with me."
"6/30/2020 3:03:32 PM",-6,"","","We are strongly against amending the charter to remove police department. The riots and violence after the riots fully reveal the sad truth that if we do not advocate law and order, crimes will start destroying our community. 99% of the police are doing a great job for this great city, and we definitely do not want this wonderful city turning to Chicago South."
"6/30/2020 3:03:57 PM",5,"","","MPD has proven itself beyond reform. New, effective public safety solutions are needed urgently and this amendment is a necessary step on the path to those solutions."
"6/30/2020 3:04:28 PM",-5,"","","I am opposed to a change in the city charter being put on the ballot this November.  The rush to put this through with no plan being given is dangerous.  I know the feeling is that something has to be done and that anything is better then what we currently have.  Anything is NOT better then what we currently have when “anything” is no plan at all.  I worked in government for 34 years, much of that time involved work on policy planning.  There is research that shows that policy made during a crisis to in reaction to a crisis rarely proves to solve the problem or be helpful.  This is a huge issue and one that should have much thought and discussion.  I am not in favor of giving the city council any more power then it already has, putting this on the ballot this November puts the city at risk of that happening if it would pass.  This is a big deal and deserves thoughtful discussion and planning.  A rush to put it on the ballot this November serves no purpose."

Crimes are increasing and the protesters that don't want a police department destroyed your city.  It is ridiculous, that the City Council will think this.  It is the most stupid idea.  You need the police department so residents can obey the law.  That is problem,  most of the people that don't want the police don't to obey the laws.  If you ask every person that don't want the police department what the police did wrong to them, providing proof,I bet you they will say nothing.  It will be a grave mistake by council and Mayor Frey needs to put his foot down and tell his council police department is not going anywhere.  Abolish City Council for being stupid."
"6/30/2020 3:07:52 PM",9,"","","I agree that some changes need to be made to our police department but I am NOT in favor of disbanding.

I do not think removal would be a good change."
"6/30/2020 3:09:12 PM",8,"","","I support this charter amendment. MPD Will tell you they are asked to do too much and I'll equipped to deal successfully with the variety of needs the community has. Please prioritize housing and mental health care before policing."
"6/30/2020 3:09:15 PM",10,"","","I believe that the citizens of the city are entitled to a lot more detail in the proposal of how this recommendation is going to be planned, funded,  demented and as importantly, reviewed for effectiveness. You can’t expect an entire city to vote for a proposal with absolutely no specific planning on how this will work. In one swipe this will significantly change the direction of an incredibly important part of the city’s operation and every resident of the city of Minneapolis is entitled to understand and support any substantial chance moving forward."
"6/30/2020 3:09:19 PM",0,"","","No, no, no!  This is a knee-jerk reaction by the Council without any benefit of discussion or a well-thought out plan to protect the citizens and visitors of Minneapolis.  Until you have a viable alternative do NOT put this on the ballot.  People will vote to get rid of the police because they mistakenly think it will solve all the city's problems.  It will not. Secondly, this is nothing more than a naked power play by the Council so they can run the City.  Where is the balance of powers?  The U.S. does not put the House of Representatives in charge of the country.  Why should the Council have that much power. Lastly, fix the Police Department.  Get rid of the Union and the collective bargaining agreement (or whatever it's called).  Find ways to make the police work for us."
"6/30/2020 3:09:21 PM",3,"","","This decision is long overdue. The police department as currently funded, operated, and protected, does not do our residents justice, especially the poorer neighborhoods and POC. A completely new police department can potentially be part of the solution, but in its current state it is broken and needs to be tossed out. Newer ideas, technologies, and community resources can do most of the police's current jobs and provide better results."
"6/30/2020 3:10:07 PM",-2,"","","I oppose  the proposed charter amendment.  Go ahead and create different divisions within the police department, addressing the additional needs beyond protecting life and property.  Make changes within the department regarding discipline and racism.  But DO NOT send unarmed social workers and the like into the community to answer calls that are known to be potentially dangerous.  Do not have unarmed Community of Safety personnel trying to keep the public safe in this country where so many people are already armed.  I will be voting ""no"" on the proposed charter amendment."
"6/30/2020 3:11:16 PM",6,"","","I am opposed to seeking a charter amendment at this time.  It is irresponsible and reprehensible of the council as a whole to do this before further delineation of the proposed changes.  The citizens did not elect you on this idea nor does it emend give the citizens a reasonable opportunity to weigh in by a vote on the amendment as proposed.  Please don’t rush this. It is not what is best for the city.  Propose something later, after you get robust public comment, debate and a majority of the city to back up a more detailed proposal."
"6/30/2020 3:12:07 PM",3,"","","I would like to voice my strong opposition to this amendment.  I feel it is premature to add an amendment to change the police department until a WELL thought out and COMPLETE replacement is designed...not just a piecemeal plan that bends to the loudest and most aggressive voices in the current environment.  I have shared these views with my council member...Andrew Johnson."
"6/30/2020 3:12:27 PM",13,"","","Dear Charter Commission:  I oppose the charter amendment that would remove the requirements to maintain a police department.  I believe that the City Council is trying to move way, way too fast with this issue.  I encourage you to push this out to at least 2021 and carefully and thoughtfully (like you always do) weigh all the pros and cons. The city that I love so much is experiencing too much turmoil to permit this proposed charter amendment to move forward at this time. Thank you."
"6/30/2020 3:12:30 PM",-5,"","","I am against defunding the police.  Especially with the lack of leadership in the mayor office and city council.

I move to defund and remove Bender, Cano, Jenkins and Cunningham."

I look forward to voting for it in November and working with city council to create public safety without police who have lost any ounce of trust they had left in this city.

"6/30/2020 3:12:47 PM",5,"","","Through extensive discussion among citizens in my area, this comprehensive statement was developed by a former mental health practitioner.  She has given me permission to use her succinct sunmary. We are asking for this vote to amend the city charter to be placed on hold until all these Stakeholders can be brought into the discussion. There are many agencies, Henn. County, Human Services,, mental Health Services, Homeless Coalition, Emergency and Crisis Services, Adult and Child Protection, ChemDep., 911 Call Center, Foster Care, Domestic Abuse Services, in addition to the Police Dept, the list could on. These are the many services provided in the community that all have their own rules, regulations, laws. So to consider reallocating resources from the Police to these agencies, needs very thoughtful Discussion to occur in order to work together, redefine responsibilities and partnerships. THEN a plan should come forward the public can vote on. This needs to be done in a competent and thorough manner. There is great momentum across the country right now and it will continue and get much greater buy-in from more people if we do this the right way. The big societal issues, poverty, jobs, housing, healthcare are huge national issues that are underlying many of the issues requiring the need for above services and they need tremendous amount of work, but beyond the scope of this Amendment."

I keep it to remember the anger and then being scared, of what did and was going to happen.  What you are proposing is not leadership, it is activism. I have told my children you will encounter two types of people in your life. When presented with a problem, some (too few) will immediately think of a solution, but most will have to determine who is at fault, before they can offer a solution.

I would like to leave my apartment walk downtown and not have to dodge bicycles on the sidewalk and be hit up for money EVERY time I go out. If the City Council would manage and deal with all the issues of All city residents instead of trying to live in la la land then real police reform might stand a chance.

Their flagrant disregard of a public forum concerning policing policy was in full evidence at Powderhorn Park, with their display of ""dismantling the police"". We, as citizens,  demand the right to be properly represented by the elected person to each ward. That has not happened. Passing this resolution greatly diminishes the ability of every citizen to be heard and respected. Also - according to an email sent by the city of Minneapolis, the Charter Commission has AT LEAST 60 days before submitting a decision.

There is no statistical data that even justifies trying to dismantle the Police Department, and you also know that. The police are a force for good, they safe lives daily, and trying to reduce or remove them would only put people’s lives at risk, that is quite frankly grossly negligence on your part, as it presents a public safety hazard. you’re approach to the matter would only create more problems than fix them, and your lack of common sense only proves that you are unfit to serve as city council members and you should immediately get replaced. you are being selfish and childish, and I am not reserving my opinions of you to myself, because you honestly don’t deserve the respect of the public. the crime rate is augmenting in the inner cities were police reduction measures are being taken, which is a clear indication that reducing the police to any measure is detrimental to the safety of the general public. black lives matter and antifa should not be a driving factor to make decisions for the rest of your constituents, because at the end of the day, many of those so called activists don’t even live im the local area, and if things the dangerous for the local citizens, they simply won’t care, because they won’t affected by it. And no calling the police in a matter of personal safety does not come from a place of privilege, its a basic human right you are denying the people from the city of Minneapolis. the increase in crime lately is a great indication that you are taking a harmful and dangerous approach, and people who lack the kind of responsibility needed to ensure the safety and peace of a community, should not be entrusted with such decisions. In addition you have been using thousands of tax payer dollars for your own private security, while attempting to leave the people of Minneapolis unprotected. non of you deserve the benefits of security and safety, if the people in your city will not be extended those same benefits. Hypocrites and traitors is what you are! another thing that is concerning is that you want to replace trained police officers with years of experience in dangerous situations, who know the community very well, with a group of inexperienced people that might walk into violent situations without a clue, putting their lives in danger as well. Sincerely your lack of honesty, moral character, and care for the safety of the people of the city you are supposed to represent, is a testament if why we need the Charter as a protective layer against anarchy and sedition, and why we need a police force that is not governed nor controlled by the city council, but it is its own separate department.  all if you should resign immediately, and the federal and state government should file charges against you for putting politics over public safety. I would draw you a picture of what the words I wrote mean, so that you could have better comprehension of the point I am trying to convey, as by what you are proposing shows that you might not be very intellectually or cognitively aware of reality, and the harmful consequences that it could have on innocent people, and specially on the most vulnerable!

It essential that the amendment removes the mandated size of the police force and restructures the dept to include a multi-faceted approach.

And I dare say I  not the only one."
"6/30/2020 3:20:33 PM",0,"","","This is a mistake and I cannot even imagine that it has gotten to this point. I do not support removing the police force that is in place. These are trained professionals with all the experience and know how. Instead lets look at how the city of Minneapolis can step up and help the current Police force with what they need for success. Lets disband the City council and vote in people that will help the community and not throw blame to a division as a whole."
"6/30/2020 3:20:58 PM",6,"","","A 45 year resident of the city, I oppose this amendment as proposed.  - Authority of the mayor over the police would be diluted among 13 Council members when we need more focused accountability, not less - A second layer of bureaucratic responsibility is established between the head of law enforcement and elected officials, again diminishing accountability for police conduct  - Odd to describe the qualifications for the new department in negative terms (""non law enforcement"") - While the amendment is presented as a way for the Council to take charge, I believe it is actually a way for members to distract and delay action on controversial reforms (such as union representation), avoid individual responsibility when it comes time for reelection, and give mere surface appearance of concern to residents who want to see real changes in police behavior.  - Instead, the city should enact reforms within the current language and our first black police chief should be looked to for operational ideas that could make a real difference in addressing community voices for change. If specific ideas with support from elected officials and the public require charter revisions, propose them at that time.  - No objection to changing the name of the police department to the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention and incorporating allied functions    - I have no confidence in the ability of the current council as a group to manage changes needed to reduce police misconduct and restore respect in our police. They do not deserve more authority, yet are asking for a blank check. But even with a competent council, I believe the proposed changes would not be in the best interest of the city."
"6/30/2020 3:21:01 PM",4,"","","As a resident living in downtown Minneapolis, I fully support this change. While I do believe that sometimes armed officers are necessary, it’s much, much less frequent than currently. I believe this is due to the lack of other help for “public nuisance” issues such as panhandling, public urination, or general disturbances. I believe the preponderance of police calls downtown could better be served with someone able to get people the housing and/or mental health resources they need. And since the amendment still allows for a police force, those issues that do present a real danger can be handled by the appropriate officers."
"6/30/2020 3:21:06 PM",6,"","","I am writing to express my support for this charter amendment. Attempts at incremental police reform have been happening as long as I've been a resident of this city, and they have accomplished nothing.

"6/30/2020 3:21:19 PM",-12,"","","I have been apart of this city for a long time and you need to regain trust within the community with the police force. You have the right chief there, losing the police will only lose you businesses, revenue from tourism, and put people in harmful situations. The city has been in a tough situation for years, but recent crime rates have went up and violent crimes at that. Please look for a way to reform the system we have in place."
"6/30/2020 3:21:28 PM",-2,"","","I strongly support the proposed amendment to the city charter and hope we will be given the chance to vote on it. The recent murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin was not the first tragedy caused by a police department that is too prone to respond to non-emergencies with violence and seems to encourage its employees to forget fundamental human empathy. The subsequent documented use of chemical irritants and flashbang grenades on peaceful protesters showed that the the police as currently configured cannot keep themselves from harming the citizens they should be protecting, even when they know they are being filmed. What do they do to helpless people when no one can see them? If the charter commission were to prevent the public from voting on an amendment that has the backing of a supermajority of the city council and a large number of residents, it would make many of us question how responsive the democratic process is."

I support the amendment because I hope the with committed ongoing conversations and actions from council members with communities we can transform public safety for residents of Minneapolis. I want the council to redirect MPD funds to social service and other existing and new organizations to meet the safety needs of residents more effectively and compassionately. Mental health, domestic violence, vagrancy, drug possession, minor crimes, and many other things would be better handled by non-police entities that have more appropriate training for those issues. I do not want senior MPD officials to remain in a small police force or moved to other functions. I do not trust any MPD, but especially senior force members to respect community and have our best interests at heart. They have shown that over and over again. I want them to be retrained for non-police employment opportunities, and not hired by unsuspecting jurisdictions. MPD is broken fundamentally, and the failure of reforms and leadership make that case for itself. Abolition is comforting and hopeful, not scary."

"6/30/2020 3:27:07 PM",-4,"","","I support the amendment, although I think it should make less room for police in the new department.

We need safe, plentiful public housing, we need to stop the privatization of public housing, and we need schools that don’t traumatize their students! Build homes not jails!"
"6/30/2020 3:27:25 PM",6,"","","I disagree with this amendment. Do not disband the police or try to restructure from the top down. Changing it at this time without having a firm plan on how we will address changes isn't a good idea. In fact we need to increase the police force so that there is less pressure on each individual order. This will allow more police to interact with the community and thus improve the relations with the police.

This is pure knee jerk reaction and a bunch of buzzwords. There is no real plan in place to implement the idea they have. there is no real means to do any of this. this is just a re-naming of what we have and hoping everyone will forget about it. The issues with the police force in Minneapolis need to be fixed within the structure that exists.  This city needs actual strong leadership, something we haven't had for as far back as i remember. Leadership that steps up when it the hardest. Not what i saw last month, our mayor crying while my city burned. A mayor begging for the national guard but having no plan to use them. I agree that we as residents need more mental health training for our officers, more people that are not always armed that respond to certain calls, more training for our 911 system to triage these calls. but to just rename to MPD to something new and hope that appeases everyone? This will put us right back here in a few years. And unless the plan is a big secret that is all this looks like to me. But how would anyone know since the mayor and city council are refusing to reply to calls, emails, and questions asked in person by the citizens. and for the record i have tried contacting my CM Cam Gordon on the Nextdoor app, Facebook, and through email with no reply. This amendment is nothing more than lip service to the public. This will put us back on fire in a few years. This will, in the long run, cripple the City of Minneapolis as residents leave, businesses leave, convention and major sporting events leave.  This cannot be allowed to happen.

"6/30/2020 3:30:08 PM",-38,"","","As many large cities who reduce funding or seek to transform policing are showing, the progressive-sponsored charter in Mpls is going to have serious ramifications for the lives of the citizenry in our city. The following facts are undeniable: 1. The people do not support a reduction in funding for law enforcement, despite the fact that some reforms are needed. 2. Violent crime is already skyrocketing, here in Mpls and in many other cities. 3. An anarchic mentality is in dramatically increasing on Mpls streets, as seen in the behaviors of many who do not respect their neighbors' rights to live peacefully. This is destroying our quality of life. 4. When law enforcement is underfunded and absent, it is the vulnerable, elderly, disabled, and young that suffer. Women are put at higher risk, and criminals and violent offenders always go after those who can least defend themselves. 5. The language of ""privilege"" is replacing the language of ""freedom"" and ""rights,"" so that when good people seek to prosper and help their neighbors, they are seen as the cause of others' suffering, while criminals are excused. 6. Most importantly, these facts are so obvious, that it is impossible to conclude that our city council members are not aware of them. They know that, despite some concerning issues in the culture of law enforcement, the real danger is not to young black citizens, but to the vulnerable, and the rights of these people to law enforcement protection will be lost. The city council members words and behaviors have convinced me their true objectives are not to reform police-community relations. Their willingness to risk the lives of our vulnerable neighbors convinces many that it is not the health and safety of our community that they want, but rather to create crisis and suffering that can be manipulated to further their own ambitions. Those who have resources and opportunities will leave Mpls, while the vulnerable will suffer. Our city council members, who have hired security for their own protection, understand this, and wants this. Back-and-forth dialogue with them is fruitless. Voting for more conservative city council members is mandatory. My street address is not included, because I am genuinely concerned about retribution. Maybe this is without warrant, but we should be concerned when people perceive it to be so."

While I strongly want a radical change to the police department I feel it is a disservice to have people vote on something the city council has yet to figure out.  I’ve read a different answer from each council member in explaining the changes.  These types of radical changes are best done by building a consensus around a thought out plan.  I feel the city council is just trying to score political points in an election year instead of listening to the community they are supposed to represent.  It is reckless and worse yet it could possibly harm the very community you are wishing to help"

A disproportionately white population of folks who don't live in North Minneapolis, (and never would) and non-Northsiders are behind dismantling the police. Most African American folks I know demand that the police radically transform by any means necessary but we don't want announcements about getting rid of the police now. Our children are being shot and killed on our streets. Protecting them is our #1 priority– Not politics! 3. The City Council's announcement that it plans on dismantling the police is immature, premature and dangerous. We are in the middle of the greatest crime and violence spree in our neighborhood since 1996 when Mpls was dubbed 'Murderapolis.' Now is not the time to tell those committing unchecked violence daily that we are getting rid of the police. This has become a license to kill and shoot. 4. Under the new charter the new 'department of safety,' would report to 14- Council people who are responsible for different parts of the city that have different needs. Currently the police are held accountable by the Mayor and Police Chief. 14 bosses are too much! 5. We haven't fully supported nor given a real chance to the first African American police chief, Arradondo. He has already stepped up and refused to negotiate with the police union– something which no other chief has done before. 6. The timing on this is just bad.

I am 100% in favor of the removal of the police department and the establishment of a more community-centered organization for the betterment of Minneapolis and the safety of its residents. It should NOT have taken the death of an innocent man for this to be taken into consideration, but we have an incredible opportunity to pioneer a system (no offense to Cambridge, NJ) that could be used as a model for other cities around the country and indeed in other parts of the world. It is very clear that an institution so incredibly racist such as the MPD cannot be changed and thus the best path forward seems to be a new organization built from the ground up with safety and support in mind. We can't undo the hurt that has been brought upon our residents, especially disproportionately to residents that are also people of color, but we can ensure that going forward, Minneapolis will be a safe place for all, ensuring that no one fears for their life simply due to the color of their skin."
"6/30/2020 3:39:44 PM",-8,"","","First: There should be no charter amendment vote until there is a plan! Otherwise voters are being asked to vote on a pig in a poke, sight unseen. Betting our safety on the city council's ability to dream up an alternative solution to a problem virtually no city in the nation (world?) has been able to solve is absurd. Second: Such a risky move should not be made without first exhausting other solutions. The City Council claims it has done so, but it has not. It has not supported reforms requested by our excellent police chief. It has not beaten a path to the legislature to ask for reforms. ""First do no harm.""  Third: The assumption underlying the ""defunding"" of the police dept is, in effect, that there is no — or at least very little — evil in the world that we can't ""social work"" our way out of. No; that is either an infantile or a disingenuous proposal. There are and always have been bad people, and it is the fundamental responsibility of government to protect society from them.  Fourth: This is a particularly dangerous time in history to be entertaining a proposal that even hints of risking public safety. The man in the White House and his followers are actively fanning the flames of discord, no doubt hoping for a civil war to save his presidency. The pandemic has frightened people. We live in a hair-trigger environment that bad people, sensing confusion and lack of trust in government, can take advantage of.  Fifth: It is irresponsible to have the police reporting to 13 or 14 people — who are, historically,  in perpetual disagreement with each other. No one would be in charge of public safety. Six: I hope the Charter Commissioners recognize this proposal for what it really is, at least in the minds of some City Council members: a power grab. It would further weaken our weak-mayor system, making the City Council president the only true political power in the city.   Seven: Instead of an amendment to put the MPD/Public safety under the City Council, we should be looking at a charter change that would reshape our municipal government as a strong-mayor system. That would help give greater direction and order to our city, eliminate at least some of its proclivity toward dysfunction."

As a social worker, I could not imagine not having the police to call to help with mental health calls and child protection calls.

If the police department is replaced with other people (whoever they may be) the possibility that these individuals will freeze, flight or fight in dangerous situations is very risky. they are not trained like police officers. This is a scary thought. The city is an uncertain place. Even though the police are not removed from the city. There are citizens that act like they are and think they can do whatever they want. My sister in law lives right next to where there was the shooting in uptown where 11 people were injured and 1 person died. She is trying to get enough money to move out even though her job is there.

The police get such a bad rap when less than one-tenth of a percent is a problem.  Throw out the baby with the bathwater.   These guys are heroes putting on their uniforms daily and putting their lives on the line for a lame salary.  Why don't you increase their pay, increase their training, and allow them to do their job?  When one bad incident happens it doesn't mean you stop law enforcement.  This city is going to turn into Chicago statistics by the increase.  The police have done so many incredible things for our city.  And you give them a slap in the face.

If one uses statistics from past months, those may not be reflective of the current climate of uncertainty and unrest. The uncontrolled looting and rioting that left our beloved in city in ruins and us residents of South Minneapolis vulnerable and terrorized MUST NOT be allowed to happen again.

One fundamental responsibility of government is to protect the well-being of its citizens. The City Council has clearly abrogated their responsibility in this domain.

History points out that when you remove something, a vacuum is created, and the most powerful force enters the vacuum... the process that is afoot risks creating greater instability.  Please no I see no good path for disbanding the police department.  Is there room for a different approach to dealing with certain types of calls?  Of course.

This City Council has appeared to pander to the media and listen to only one group; not all constituents, which is what the job entails and for what my taxes pay.  I believe their actions and planned actions are and will cause grave consequences to the businesses and safety of the residents of this city. I believe that the Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and violence prevention should be something that is discussed with the community and voted on by the community before the City Council removes the Police Department as a Charter Department, Article VII and Article VIII.  If you are planning to have year-long community engagement and input in this process, then why do we need to make this change now?  The City Council does not need more power over this process, especially since they do not include the community they serve in the process.  The recent acts of Council Members have made me lose trust in these city leaders. Based on how this situation has been handled, it appears the agenda is not about color of skin or equality, it is about the agendas and political pursuits of the City Council. If past behavior is any sign of the future, then I will make my voice heard at the polls when the time comes. I am 59 years old, grew up on the North side and have lived here all my life.

"6/30/2020 3:50:02 PM",-39,"","","I am a twelve year resident of the Phillips Neighborhood. I love this neighborhood, Minneapolis, and my neighbors. My wife and I are active, engaged community members who have chosen to raise our children here. In the past weeks I have joined protests, cleaned up looted streets and businesses, actively rallied our neighbors together as we faced violence and chaos, and stood behind community members and business owners to protect our corner store, the only source of food for neighbors for several days during the riots. I am deeply grieved by the murder of George Floyd on top of years of police bias, wartime mentality, corruption and overall lack of police accountability that has lead to the harm of my neighbors and community. I have wept over the lives impacted by the destruction of small businesses, clinics, housing, and food supply for our community.  Things must change. In particular, the power of the police union should be further limited. Qualified immunity leaves ""bad eggs"" in power for years after abusing residents and furthering toxic police culture. Deeper relationships with the community MUST be developed. However, I am deeply concerned with the proposal put forward by the City Council to remove the police dept from the city charter. Minneapolis is no stranger to violence, both outside forces of oppression and chaos from within.  Our city needs a better police force that is accountable for it's actions. We do not need a power vacuum that will exacerbate an already growing problem.  A just government requires checks and balances. The balance of power in our city already tips towards the city council. The proposal moves the Police Dept/Community Safety And Violence Prevention away from the mayor and under the authority of the city council, giving even more power to an already powerful city council.  The proposal lacks any sort of actual plan.  We want change. Why not create a plan of what actually would replace the police dept, and allow residents to vote on something concrete? Instead this proposal gives the city council a blank check to do whatever they would like. What reason do we have to trust the council to create a plan we trust and approve? If they have a plan residents approve of, why not allow us to vote on that? Why not use the coming months to get feedback from residents, and shape a concrete proposal? This current proposal lacks transparency and clarity while holding the power to drastically alter our city for decades to come. Why rush such a seismic change? We have a police chief who knows the city, knows the police dept, and is committed to change. Why would the city council and mayor not instead rally behind the police to bring about change rather than burning it all down instead? Would the council rather metaphorically spray paint ""ACAB"" on our city charter? It is easy to tear something down. Destruction is within the power of anyone with a hammer and gas mask. Building something worthwhile requires patience, discipline, a close eye on reality, and commitment. Our city has experienced enough destruction in the past month. We need our leaders to build our future with vision, precision, and accountability. This proposal lacks all three.  We are faced with problems created by those with power using it violently against our community without accountability. The City Council's response apparently is to give themselves more power with less accountability, with the assumption that violence is not an issue in our community. The fallout of this approach will be predictably devastating to those most vulnerable in our city. We must do better.  Sincerely,  Minneapolis Resident and homeowner."
"6/30/2020 3:50:36 PM",-14,"","","The MPD presents a classic 'Principle-agent problem:' The MPD is not responsive to the community it serves or the public officials charged with overseeing the department.  Officer Bob Kroll and the police union have made concerted efforts over many years and through several police chiefs, mayors, and city council members to thwart all meaningful oversight and reforms.  They firmly believe that no one can tell them what to do or how to do it. It may be the case that there are only a few ""bad apples"" among the 800 police officers, but Kroll and the union have made it impossible to separate the bad apples from the good. Therefore, to address this principle-agent problem, the MPD must be disbanded. Concurrently, a new public safety organization must be established, which would include the reconstitution of a new police department with a limited scope of responsibilities.  It is critical that this new public safety organization be structured such that the same principle-agent problem cannot reoccur.  Elected officials, including the mayor and the city council, must have absolute authority to oversee the organizaion."

(One dirty cop)  I also live in the community real estate agents refer to as ""highest crime relative to Hennepin County""  I have been the victim of at least 25 crimes in my community - all young Black men.  I have needed police and they have been there.  Our city has headed in the direction of soft on crime and this isn't at all helpful (abolishing and defunding police).  My home was broken into by a young Black man while I was sleeping.  He was released and pounding on my door the next day (I never met this person, I did not know him).  As he continued to terrorize me, the case was dismissed, he was not charged.  This person was from Chicago.  How are community programs supposed to help residents of Minneapolis with criminals from Chicago coming to take advantage of soft- on- crime Minneapolis?  The City Council needs to support police (why wasn't the Chief given the additional officers he requested?)  The City Investigative, Internal Affairs, and Civil Rights Commissions need overhauling, not the police.  The Police Department has been trying to establish community relations.  I have been to events -coffee with police, National Night Out, Picnics and open houses at my Precinct...     My neighbor, a Black woman, knew G. Floyd and former officer D. Chauvin from their former place of employment.  She thinks the incident was personal.  G. Floyd's brother stated that the incident was personal.  White officers, a Black officer, an Asian officer... what proof is there that this was a racial incident?  It was a horrific display of inhumanity, but that wasn't why our city was partly destroyed.  Certainly reform and revision is necessary (and has been for a while).  Training, use of force, accountability, qualified immunity -all need looking into.  But City Council members who demand Police protection for themselves should not be messing around with Police protection for the citizens of Minneapolis.  I have been satisfied, for the most part, with our precinct police both personally and with my business (noting room for improvement).  And victims of crime aren't coming from ""a place of privilege"" as our Council President stated on national TV (made Minneapolis laughable to much of the rest of the country).  Victims of crime need police.  And I do not trust social workers handling vicious, violent, drugged persons that their own relatives can't even handle (I am not a trained officer, but I have been in a position with these mentally altered persons where I feared for my life).  Reminder:  hard core criminals are coming from Chicago to take advantage of soft-on-crime Minneapolis.

Please install enforcement of nuisance crimes, gateways to harder criminal activity.  What does unicorn and rainbow thinking get us?  Look at Lake Street.  Thank You."

As the city continues to make changes to move away from policing as we operate today, towards a future of true public safety I hope you consider several concerns both in this charter and in the implementation of the new department. You state that the department will be adequately funded - please further define what adequate funding means. In the prior language around the police department there are very specific metrics about law enforcement staffing, and I would encourage the council to be clear about what adequate funding would look like to ensure this department is funded. I also strongly recommend the council continue to work closely with advocates on their vision for safety in our city. We need a clear and bold vision about how any new department charged with public safety will not continue to perpetuate the same harm to black and brown communities. We also know that divestment from a police department is not enough - we must increase public support in housing, education, family support, employment etc. We will not see the transformative change we hope to see in our city unless we are investing in the people in our city in a much broader way."

"6/30/2020 3:51:23 PM",20,"","","I support a foundational and sincere change to how policing works in Minneapolis. From the top down, the current system is based in racism and perpetuates inequality and police brutality. Yes, I believe there are good cops. But when they exist in a system that protects bad cops, it makes no difference. This is absolutely unacceptable, and it simply cannot continue.  I've come to realize how many calls to the police really don't need a police response. There are mental health calls, minor disagreements with neighbors, noise and other non-violent ordinance complaints, etc. Three years ago I needed to call the police due to a violent threat I received. The threat was vague and non-imminent. They spent 20 minutes with me and offered to file a report. There was no need for them to respond. Cars and bikes are stolen in my neighborhood regularly. Occasionally there is a home robbery. Police are notified. Rarely, if ever, are suspects caught in the act.  That said, in order for this amendment to have ANY chance of success at the ballot box or the Mayor's desk, it needs more clarity and definition. People will simply not vote for this major structural change en masse without knowing what they are getting in return. I can tell you there are VERY different interpretations out there of what ""defund the police"" means, and the proposed amendment does not clarify the intent. Amend, defund, abolish, restructure, reform are all terms that are floating around, and there is no unified understanding of what ""removal of the Police Department"" means. At face value, sure, it means what it says. But replacing police with peace officers sounds like semantics. There will need to be widespread supporting documentation and absolute clarity on the ballot in order for taxpayers to support this measure. As is, you'd be asking residents to take a leap of faith with many families' safety and well-being.  I would like to see peace officers paired with social workers and EMTs. No longer should police be able to respond alone to mental health calls to 9-1-1. I support ending qualified immunity. I support officers (including peace officers) being required to report questionable, violent, or racist language and behavior. I support de-escalation being the focus of peace officers' training. I support a mandatory percentage of peace officers being required to live within metro limits, so as to build relationships with the population they serve.  I strongly believe that specific department structure and responses need to be outlined. But scenarios MUST be addressed in order to make this happen. Do we plan to send peace officers to an active mass shooting scenario? Is SWAT maintained, or any sort of crisis team? I believe in and support fundamental restructuring, but there ARE times when force will be needed, and people will need to hear specifics about what a Peace Officer's role will be, and whom they collaborate with in order to respond to such a wide range of social situations. Finally, a timeline needs to be addressed. The increase in shootings and violence we've seen in the past two weeks is due to people thinking this change happened overnight. It needs to be crystal clear to voters what the timeline for this transition would look like. I assume years, not months or weeks. People need to understand that in order for this to have any hope of passing.  Thank you"

But time and time again we have witnessed the brutality that the Minneapolis Police Department has committed against Black, brown, Indigenous, and white people.

We are coming together from all parts of the city to demand that our neighborhoods be safe for every one of us, and that the resources we contribute to the city be used to create services that make us healthy and whole, not kill us.

"6/30/2020 3:53:28 PM",-19,"","","I fully support the Charter Amendment to remove the Police Department and establish a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department. The main reason for my support is that, quite frankly, I don't feel like I can use or recommend anyone else use the police as a resource. I'm a young, middle-class white woman living in South Minneapolis, demographic information I share because it means that I am not in the populations disproportionately affected by the failures of the Minneapolis policing system. Yet, I would not call them. It's unclear to me what benefit comes from having the Minneapolis police. Setting aside, for a moment, the evidence of their extreme bias and toxic work culture, on a purely ""job evaluation"" level they seem to serve little purpose.  If it's for a break-in or a robbery, then the police aren't preventative. They are simply responding after the fact, and in my experience are not very helpful in ensuring that future crimes won't occur or that lost property is recovered. It would be far more valuable for us to put resources towards addressing the causes of crime in the first place.  Furthermore, police have proven themselves poorly equipped to support someone who has experienced an assault (sexual or physical), mental health emergency, or drug emergency. Their most successful role seems to be in traffic control, a job that can be largely done using technology.  That lack of value alone  is reason for this charter amendment, but in addition to that the Minneapolis police system has proven itself committed to supporting brutality and racism in such a way that all past efforts to reform, retrain, or reimagine their role have failed spectacularly.  We find ourselves with a structure that allows abuse to flourish and destroys any efforts by individual officers to be effective community resources. What is the point of having the police if they are at best ineffective and at worst actively harmful to our city? At residents of this city, we deserve to vote for a better system. I look forward to voting on this issue, and appreciate the work of the City Council and Charter Commission to put this on the ballot."

Moreover, the union has made it nearly impossible to hold cops accountable. I’m white and have few to zero negative interactions with cops, but a police force that doesn’t serve everyone and keep everyone safe is not a police force I want for my community.

Police reform is appropriate, whole-sale public safety changes should not be made quickly without due process. I have compiled my brief plea below, given only one hour to submit my comments on the matter. No Plan in Place, Moving Too Quickly for Public Process. The Minneapolis City Council does not have a solid plan in place to so-called “defund the police” or even change the City Charter. Changes to public safety should be carefully planned with vast amounts of community input and expertise – anything short of that is irresponsible. We should not move forward with any changes to public safety(not even changes to the Charter) until we have a well-vetted, community-supported,or even Mayor-supported plan. There has not been enough time to submit comments for this milestone on such an important issue. With continued unrest and division in our great City, this is not the time to make such drastic changes quickly and without proper process. This affects all residents of the City, and should NOT be made based on voices of a few (as is happening right now). No Public-Funded Private Security for Council Members. It is not appropriate for Minneapolis City Council members to have private security funded by City of Minneapolis taxpayers. The Council is not above its constituents and should not receive special security detail outside the protection of the Minneapolis Police Department that they want to defund. This is hypocritical, and furthers their agenda to defund the police department. As a resident of the Howe neighborhood, the past few months have greatly affected our family. During the riots we felt unsafe in our own home. Defunding the Police Department and changing the City Charter is the wrong move for the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, and the State of Minnesota.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

It has been common knowledge to explicitly request a CIT officer who has received specialized training in de-escalation and crisis intervention techniques which has been helpful in working with folks who have a history of trauma, and a lot of them with specific trauma around police enforcement.  What I never understood was why this was a ""special"" kind of officer.  Why not all police officers were expected to have received thorough training in de-escalation and crisis intervention techniques, with a trauma-informed, person-centered lens. I appreciate that there are going to be emergency, potentially violent situations that are within the scope of police type services however, on a whole I believe in a department that focuses on safety and is pro-active in violence prevention not one that leads with force.  It's important to include the members of our community whom are being affected most often by police brutality and injustice,  in our conversations about reform in order to address the needs at hand and not look to an out-of  -touch, culturally incompetent faction of our community to do the talking.

There are actions that the Council could take, in cooperation with the Mayor and the Chief of Police, that would accomplish many of the goals toward police accountability. For some reason the Council has decided not to pursue those efforts. I do agree that removing specific language about police staffing levels related to city population would give the Council more flexibility in utilizing peace officers vs other public safety workers - but see no need for the Council to strip oversight of police from the Mayor, nor for the Council to lay out specific experience qualifications for a new Community Safety Director.

If you say no, I say no to your charter, because that shows how naive and stupid you are.  Not to be mean, but that's the hard truth.  (MN is a concealed carry state, and the # of firearms nationwide has drastically increased since COVID-19, and then further after the riots).  Most of these gun owners are responsible and non-violent, and now see a greater need for firearms due to the civil unrest, increase in violent crimes, and now the possibility of ""defunding"" the police.  However, CRIMINALS WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FIREARMS legally or illegally. 2.)  Who decides, and which types of responders will go to which calls?  If you send (unarmed) social workers only to a domestic, and the perp has a firearm, or is otherwise dangerous, what kind of training and self defense is each group of responder going to have in order to protect themselves, as well as the other people involved. I am absolutely NOT a gun fanatic, but I feel like I have a much better understanding of what's actually happening and do NOT want to see those responding to calls in even more danger because people who don't REALLY UNDERSTAND what it's like to be in these situations, jobs, or lifestyles are naive and ignorant, which, sadly, is exactly how it feels. You say you have models, this is not new, etc, etc - general, political, feel good, cover up the truth and avoid answering the question responses, but I want to know exactly which law enforcement people, and which people who actually have the most experience with violent crime, etc (who used to be perpetrators, or those who've had a MASSIVE amount of experience dealing with it.  You need people on both of those ends of the spectrum in order to do this correctly, as it's pretty evident, none of you really have that much experience with it. I want to know exactly what... branches there will be? And how many people in each branch.  and what each branch will be responsible for (responding to, or what programs they will be, and how those are going to create direct, immediate results)? What will be the hiring process for every person in each of these branches?  Who will be responsible for creating and enforcing all/each of the protocols of each branch?  What consequences will there be if the protocols are not followed?  Who will create/decide on these consequences? What will the budget be for each of these branches? I think one of the best things for the city council to do, is a workshop with police officers where each one of you, one at a time, has to physically control and handcuff a larger, muscular, completely unarmed person (who can be untrained in any sort of self defense, as well) who acts as a perp.  I also think it's very naive to ban choke holds, unless it's an for an extended period of time.  While you're trying to wrestle that pretend perp to the ground - if you have any clue about what your doing controlling the head can be extremely useful, and safe.  I'm guessing whom ever banned choke holds has very little knowledge of how they actually work. I AM 100% FOR DE-ESCALATION TECHNIQUES.  I unfortunately can't remember what city implemented it, but I remember seeing that it had very good results.  I'm 100% in favor of implementing de-escalation techniques.  Unfortunately, de-escalation is NOT going to work 100% of the time. I am also 100% for BJJ (Brazillian Jiu Jitsu) training for all police officers, or whatever you want to call them."
"6/30/2020 4:00:19 PM",-10,"","","Police reform needs to happen but if “defunding the police” means fewer cops and not policing “low level” crimes we are on track to turn into San Francisco, LA, Seattle and other major cities/states where we are seeing a mass exodus of citizens simply leaving. This will lead to loss of local business (already occurring), degraded tax base and struggling schools/services. Not enforcing “quality of life” laws puts areas in a downward spiral."
"6/30/2020 4:00:22 PM",2,"","","I lived in Mpls 1973 - 1991. I feel that revisions need to be done with all law enforcement agencies. Along with Trauma Informed Care- there should be transparency about Anxiety-Depression and Compassion Fatigue/PTSD among officers.  You MUST have a good plan in place and working for 1-3 months before disbanding the police Dept.  Otherwise there could be chaos just like the riots... when I travel to Mpls, which I do frequently, I want to feel safe! Thank you!"

I grew up in a country (Argentina) where after a brutal dictatorship the police force was greatly reduced. As a result violence has grown exponentially and the citizens are forced to put metal bars all around their houses to protect themselves and nobody can safely go out at night. The drug cartels moved in and there is nobody to push them back, please don't be naive and allow Minneapolis to became something similar. I trust chief Arradondo to do a good job."

"6/30/2020 4:01:43 PM",5,"","","A statement by city leadership in support of defunding the police emboldens criminals and crime will increase. The city of MPLS deserves strong leadership and is not getting it. Hopefully other residents will see this need and consider running for city council. A qualified candidate would be experienced in areas like  business, accounting, project management and law.  A charter amendment in not needed. What is needed is a council willing to step and do thier job."
"6/30/2020 4:01:51 PM",0,"","","I am a Saint Paul resident and will be a Minneapolis resident (in Longfellow) starting on July 20. I am a strong supporter of the proposed charter amendment.  During and in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, the MPD has demonstrated a disdain for and hostility toward Minneapolis residents, local and national journalists, other city employees, and most clearly, BIPOC community members.  Based on the feedback from long-time Minneapolis residents, this is not a new problem but one that dates back to the very formation of the MPD and that has persisted despite many attempts to reform.  The community of Minneapolis has a right to decide if the MPD should continue to exist or if it should be abolished, and approving this amendment is a step toward listening to the voices of the Minneapolis voters as they decide what public safety should look like for them."
"6/30/2020 4:02:03 PM",-2,"","","I think a total recreation of the police department is a complete waste of time and funds. There are a lot if departments that really do work well and can only suffer with a large structural change. I also think that whoever you would hire would know just how easily you will dismiss them when things don't go smoothly,  regardless of performance. It is typical of the city council to think they know more than the experts. The police were put in the schools as a kneejerk reaction to shootings in other states yet somehow it seems to be there fault for being there when the most likely did not want to be. It is not always easy to fix things but it is often worth the effort. It seems a shame you would rather go for the headline instead digging down and actually working on it.  Hiring more officers particularly with more diversity and giving them more training could go a long way. They could spend more time interacting with the community in positive ways and it would give you the time to dismiss the officers that are not living up to the new standards without the stress of being understaffed."
"6/30/2020 4:02:09 PM",-19,"","","The police are abusing their power over the citizens of our community. The violence that has been portrayed is absolutely unacceptable. There is no need for such heavy firearms and illegal teargas against unarmed civilians. Things MUST change immediately. Citizens should not feel scared to interact with the police when they are doing absolutely nothing wrong. They shouldn't feel scared for their life even if they are doing something wrong. The police are supposed to PROTECT and SERVE and enforce the law, NOT abuse power and kill people."
"6/30/2020 4:02:12 PM",-35,"","","What happened to George Floyd wad tragic.  Was that a racist white police officer?  Absolutely possible.  He had a history of being an asshole.  But the truth is, almost all cops are good people.  In 2019 less than 1% of people killed by police were unarmed black men (14).  Why were they shot?  One was naked trying to eat a teenager not responding to tasers. Another was killed accidentally, that cop was charged with murder.  Only one other black man killed by an officer was deemed not justified and that officer was also charged with murder.  Its easy to react to the raw numbers but you have to look at why.  Blacks are disproportionately killed by police officers.  Why?  Are all cops racist? Unlikely.  The truth is that blacks commit 53% of all murder in the United states.  13% of the population commit 53% of all murder.  38% of all violent crime.  Blacks put themselves in situations where deadly force may be used at a much higher rate than any other race in the United States.  Why does this happen?  A good guess is that 4 in 5 black children grow up in single parent households where they are up to 20 times more likely to end up in jail that a child with two parents.  An effort to keep the black family together would be a much better solution to preserve black lives.  100 blacks were shot in Chicago over the weekend. They were not shot by white people.  They were shot by other black people.  No riots, no one says anything, do black lives really matter?   The reason for this is for perspective.  I care about all lives.  Skin color does not matter to me.  I care about the content of a person's character.  I agree with Martin Luther King Jr. and I believe that disbanding the police will do far more harm than good.  Please reconsider."

"6/30/2020 4:02:26 PM",26,"","","I have lived in Northeast Minneapolis for the past 13 years and spent the first 12 years of my life in South Minneapolis.  I am incredibly embarrassed to be a resident of Minneapolis at this given time.  Most of our city council members (9 of the 11) should be ashamed of being so quick to pledge their support of the protesters' plea to defund/abolish the police, without even a thought to first gauge their constituents for whom they represent.  Instead, they saw an opportunity to jump on a political bandwagon of opportunity.  They were so quick to jump on board with the notion of defund/abolish the police that they couldn't even provide a viable alternative, which to this day, are still all across the board on what a replacement will look like.  This rash decision making is dangerous political rhetoric and has spread like poison across our city and beyond.  This is not how people should lead.  I was happy to learn that Kevin Reich, who represents my ward, took a more thoughtful approach and delayed his position until more information is brought forward.     There is no question that the MPD needs a drastic and complete overhaul with their continued profiling and verbal/physical assault on minorities.  They are provided with a militaristic arsenal and continue to show they are well versed in escalation vs deescalation tactics.    I'm embarrassed of our Police Federation, where they continue to prove how unions abuse their power, by protecting their own at all costs.  Defund and Abolish the union.  Take away their power to influence city leaders and lawmakers. We need our police.  There are truly bad people out there who want to hurt others through both verbal and physical violence.  Bad people have shown and will continue to take advantage of an environment where police are stretched thin or, are nonexistent.  When a few of the city council members needed to hire private security from these bad people, they did not hire safety and violence prevention officers.  The irony is real.    We need both better city and police leadership.  We need a long term vision for who we want, who we need to protect our great city.  We need better police hires, people who live in the communities they serve, people who are passionate about helping others, people who are empathetic, people who are accepting of all human beings.  The police on-boarding and continued training programs needs a complete overhaul, by literally starting from scratch and rebuilding.   We need the other great programs that have been recently mentioned too.  These are absolutely important, but taking the money away from the police is not the answer.  This should not and never be a ""are you with us or against us?"" debate.  Our city can do better than this.  Let's get a bit more creative, rather than presenting our only option is to completely tear down one program to fund another.  This continued polarization of this topic has continued to divide our city, where it should be uniting us all.   I was embarrassed that Mayor Frey didn't seize the opportunity to own the moment by changing the narrative of uniting our city.  To actually lead.  Instead, he greatly fumbled this opportunity by being a causality of answering a loaded question.  However, I do commend him for sticking to his position (not in support of defunding the police) in front of a crowd that only wanted to hear one answer.  I'm optimistic he will learn from his mistake and continue to become a better leader. Let's have a plan.  A well thought out plan.  A long term vision.  A strategy that is inclusive for all.  Our city council should know better than this.  We need to create an environment where all people feel safe and protected.  Drastic, significant and meaningful change must take place. I was happy to learn that if this were to move forward, that it will be on the ballot for voters to weigh in.  Shame on the city council for being so quick to speak on behalf of our city."

While I do believe that sometimes armed officers are necessary, it’s much, much less frequent than currently.

I believe the preponderance of police calls in our city could better be served with someone able to get people the housing and/or mental health resources they need.

Criminals are acting without fear due to a reduced police presence. No matter how many resources you put into the community, there will always be a population that commits crimes. As a proud gun owner, I can protect myself. However, many of my neighbors cannot. That is where the cops come in. Give cops less responsibility. A social worker should be called and address many issues cops are having to handle. Furthermore, anyone can write speeding/parking tickets.

People are afraid to go outside, people are afraid to visit the city, to go to the businesses that were already hurting from COVID. More will leave the city if you abolish or defund the police because people are not going to want to come down to the theaters, the restaurants, the sports games. You did not stand up for your officers when the George Floyd incident happened. You put them all as one, telling the city, telling the world that they were wrong, that they are bad, that they all need to be reformed. I hope none of the members of the City Council, the mayor or the Gov ever need the police. I have officer friends and family that are struggling to do a job they once loved because they are being spit at, having things thrown at them, having people in their face yelling Murderers. Why is that happening? Because the leaders of the city and state have told people this. Oh and what happened? Now you need to have private security because you are scared. The police are there to protect and to serve. Just because one officer is bad, doesn't make them all bad. Maybe if that officer in question would have been dealt with when his first incident happened, then he wouldn't have been there to deal with George Floyd. Maybe instead of defunding or abolishing police some of the polices should be looked at or the person in charge should have different qualifications to see that the policy is followed through instead of a slap  on the wrist.

The current budget for police should be directed to more useful areas (public schools, mental health services, projects lead by members of under-served communities, etc).

But there needs to be time given to the current Chief and for the study by the MN Dept. of Human Rights to determine the best way to do reforms.

It is irresponsible to ""ram"" through and amendment to the Charter without a well-thought out, concrete proposal describing what the proposed new Department will look like, how it will be staffed, and most importantly, how it will perform all of the functions that the numerous state statutes require be accomplished by licensed peace officers.

I urge you to ensure that Minneapolis voters are afforded the opportunity to vote the proposed amendment up or down this November.  Reasonable minds may differ as to the merits of the amendment, but Minneapolis voters are perfectly capable of making up their own minds on the issue. Preventing them from doing so would undermine the democratic foundations of our city.   The fact that the entire City Council unanimously supports referring the amendment to voters should give you some reassurance that the amendment is ripe for public referendum this November.  If the Charter Commission chooses to frustrate this unanimous exercise in democratic self-governance, I believe you run the risk of fatally delegitimizing the Charter Commission in the eyes of Minneapolis voters.  As then-Chief Judge of Hennepin County District Court told the Star Tribune in 2010, Charter Commissioners receive their positions via an undemocratic and ill-considered appointment process. The judge ""generally receives little information on which to base his choices. 'I get a bunch of applications, no letters of support, no explanation of whether someone has been a good or a bad charter commission member,' Swenson said. He also said he questions whether having one judge make the appointments is the best way."" (Steve Brandt, ""Judge removes commission chair,"" Star Tribune (July 10, 2010) available at https://www.startribune.com/judge-removes-commission-chair/98150214/.)  If you fail to refer the proposed amendment to Minneapolis voters this November, it will be obvious to every voter in Minneapolis that the Charter Commission is a rogue and anti-democratic institution, and each of you will be personally remembered as enablers of the pernicious social and institutional forces that led to the murder of George Floyd.

Any active officer who pushes back on new training methodologies gets immediate written warning and desk duty until they incorporate the new training. Police unions must be disbanded. Internal monitoring for white nationalist leanings with any positive identifications made public, and immediate termination with no recourse for appeal. If an officer is fired from the force, they lose the ability to be a law enforcement officer in perpetuity. I have thoughts about protecting so-called 'good cops' but don't know how to word that right now. Abolish qualified immunity. At the same time abolish prosecutorial immunity. If I can't have a complete and total overhaul that includes abolishing the force entirely, these are my minimums. These items are non-negotiable in my head to create a new level-set to create new habits upon."

In the days following George Floyd's murder, we joined demonstrations ad volunteered with the informal mutual aid groups. We watched Minneapolis residents come together and show up for each other. This past week, we signed the purchase agreement on a home in the Longfellow neighborhood, less than a mile from Lake and Minnehaha. Rather than being hesitant or fearful, we are proud to join this amazing community and to soon be able to call ourselves Minneapolis residents. I'm inspired by this charter amendment because it reflects the will of a people who are daring to be creative about public safety. I think we can all agree that policing in the US needs to be changed, and I see this amendment a step toward that change. While I had hoped that the amendment would more clear that no current or former police department personnel would play a role in the leadership of the new department, it still has my support."

I cannot condone my tax dollars to be used for ANY further militarization of the police force, including removing funds and ties to guns, gun protections, pepper gas, and other violent weapons used against me and my community. The funding for weaponry must be slashed t0 5% of what it used to be. Funds must be reallocated to disciplinary boards and services, body cams and body cam recording services such as records maintenance, and then reallocated to the city with a focus on education and community building. The police force may not be able to reapply or ask for more funding for another 5 years. If cops dont like it, they should learn coding and switch careers."

Instead I feel the citizens of Minneapolis should be electing these officials. We still need police to address the serious crimes occurring in our community but we need more social infrastructure in place to deal with non-violent crimes or issues such as substance abuse, addiction, domestic abuse, homelessness, mental illness, and so many other needs. I would love to see a partnership between those who are already experts in issues such as mental illness AND the police who should be relied on to address violent crimes. Rehabilitation must also be a focus for citizens who end up in jail or prison. Disparities in sentencing is another issue that must be addressed.

"6/30/2020 4:22:45 PM",-5,"","","Dear City Council Members, I applaud your commitment to real change in how Minneapolis conducts protection and well-being of its residents. It is long overdue. In that spirit, I am in favor of the proposed amendment that establishes a Community Safety & Violence Prevention Dept. However, I suggest different rhetoric which would more aptly describe what we need: not Defund, but Key-Fund. That is, absolutely fund key methods for improving standards for how police graduate to being police (or whatever we call them in the new era). I know personally, someone who was killed at the hands of police, in her own apartment, during a mental health crisis. She was vulnerable, not threatening. So I support efforts to diversify and make official response teams of professionals who are appropriate to the kind of call made. Sexual assault occurred in the night nearby recently (we heard later), and I did not know how to help, hearing someone yelling out. That is a sickening feeling. (There is a crisis of confidence in the police. They are perceived as dangerous, especially to black, indigenous, trans, queer, and poc.) Every call does not need an armed response. That said, as we who live close to the Sanctuary in Powderhorn have observed, for example, increased cases of high speed driving and drug dealing and episodes of close gun fire are part of life in an armed society. We are all vulnerable. Thus, sadly, given the widespread use of guns at large, we need to keep on staff, some number of armed responders (police) (who are trained in heightened sensitivity and assessment skills as well), for those (few) cases when citizens are at risk due to weapons in our midst. We should proceed as a community with the assumption that de-weaponizing ourselves as a people is the direction to go. But those who choose to remain on the police force must be required to complete education to promote understanding that if they are bullying then they are promoting hate and likely operating out of fear. These (therapeutic) issues must be dealt with as part of the process of becoming sworn peace officers. Bullying and racism must be seen for what it is, and what gives rise to it. The culture of hate and domination must be seen clearly as archaic, and not anything they would want to defend or condone. We must step way back in how trainees are turned into police officers, and actively, directly create a culture of respect and insight. (Obviously, guaranteed impunity, must be eliminated at the highest levels of policy through legislation.)"
"6/30/2020 4:23:08 PM",-5,"","","The Minneapolis Police department has proven itself, as a system, to be lethally violent against people of color and peaceful protestors.  As an institution it has been resistant to change, training, or reform.  The leaders of MPD have publicly stated that they have no remorse about shooting our citizens, and will not comply with policy changes made to reduce unnecessary violence.  Additionally, an armed force is only an appropriate response in a limited number of public safety situations.  I believe, in and will vote for, a new system of public safety that will be more effective and most importantly, less deadly for the residents of our city."

Until we have personnel in the precincts trained and tested in abatement techniques, it will be totally irresponsible to ""Remove the Police Department"".

So, I say hey go for it.  It'll save me some $ and I'll support my local events more often. Wonder what will happen to the city when people from out of town or out of state won't want to come visit and spend money anymore and businesses start leaving? Hopefully Mpls will give tax breaks or something so they can hire private security like the city council members did. So I say go for it and good luck!"
"6/30/2020 4:23:35 PM",4,"","","I think that this amendment is a good option for our city. Of course, I do believe the amendment also brings up many questions - such as what exactly is the Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department? I am in favor of establishing this department, and I definitely believe that an approach utilizing community safety is better than increasing the police force budget and asking them to deal with problems they are not equipped to deal with. I'm excited to see what lies ahead with our city's ability to choose who should be contacted for what emergencies. I also really hope that whatever budget isn't utilized for the police force actually goes toward solving other issues in our city. Issues such as homelessness have been neglected for so long, and any money put toward the homeless community is just a band-aid that covers up the problem, but only makes it worse. We need our funds to create actual solutions and not just brush issues under the rug."
"6/30/2020 4:23:50 PM",-6,"","","I believe that the Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and violence prevention should NOT be changed to remove the Police Department as a Charter Department, Article VII and Article VIII. The City Council in my opinion has done a terrible job managing the policing issues and to give them more power over police to make changes without first educating and engaging the community would be a detriment to our city. Especially when we are hearing that if BLM does not get their way they will ""burn it down.""  Changes to policing, including training and attracting the right people need to be made,  need, yet this charter commission change is not appropriate until voters SEE an actual plan and estimated budget.  The recent acts of Council Members have made me lose trust in these city leaders. Based on how this situation has been handled, it appears the agenda is not about color of skin , safety or equality, it is about the agendas and political pursuits of the City Council. Given recent uptick in crime and shootings over the years, we need more police not less in some communities."

"6/30/2020 4:26:14 PM",0,"","","I support the efforts to defund the police department and replace it with a community driven safety plan. The racism and homophobia in the MPD is irreparable at this point and cannot be reformed. To reduce violence we must reduce tensions in the community and invest in preventative resources instead of increased police presence and militarization/weaponry. Trust is key to community safety and must come from within our community to truly be effective. More investment in education and mental health services are also key."
"6/30/2020 4:26:20 PM",-11,"","","I think that there needs to be major changes. You have a chief of police that sued the department for racial discrimination. The MPD need to be looked at for the cases they have handled they kill minorities unfairly they arrest minorities at a much greater rate especially African Americans, and have gone rogue with several investigation groups ie gang task force, CRT team. We need to see officers documentation’s for discipline. Why ever would an officer be allowed to train others that have had as many infractions as Chauvin? The union needs to go as well as the police. Why do they have military style vehicles and weapons? It’s absurd you can’t bully people and expect people to stay silent. The other thing is why are we not holding these prosecuting attorneys responsible that work with these cops that use racism to charge there investigations, they lock these minorities up and put them in jail with out questioning if these police that have write ups and are racially driven are being honest, that’s not justice of any kind. So I say we need to protect the public but as a white woman with biracial kids I do not and can not support the current MPD. I say defund dismantle and any police officer with more than 3 complaints in 5 years no matter the outcome needs to be fired and not be able to be a cop and that the people should have the say in the hiring process."
"6/30/2020 4:26:27 PM",-3,"","","We have a duty to see the future of public safety for all residents of Minneapolis. Dismantling the MPD will be messy. It will come without support from state and governmental agencies. It will mean the breaking of a chain of racial oppression that also means breaking financial chains for very powerful people. I ask though why would we not do something because of a lack of precedent? Why would we live in fear of a world we've never known? while the one we do is know is cancerous and fatal to Black folks and people of color.  How much patience does this community have to reform and reform over and over. When the root of the problem is without reform. I would say we've seen how much patience there is left. It is there on lake and Minnehaha. It is there on lake and Chicago. The answer to the question of how much patience do we have is there in those embers.                “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills..."" -JFK"
"6/30/2020 4:26:31 PM",22,"","","Because I am not a black woman or a part of that community, I can not offer true guidance on how this change should best serve and protect those communities, but I can suggest a few forms of accountability amongst the remaining Peace Officers that will most likely resemble our current police force.  1: GO AFTER THEIR PENSIONS! While I know Peace Officers will be different than our current police, they will still most likely have pensions. When one officers grossly oversteps their responsibilities and harms another human, THE MONEY FOR THE FOLLOWING LAWSUIT AND DAMAGES WILL COME OUT OF EVERY OFFICER IN THAT DEPARTMENT'S PENSION.  This way, Peace Officers will hold one another accountable.  2: Try to get as many people as possible to live in the community they protect. If an officer lives in the suburbs, they work in the suburbs. If they want to protect and serve the inner city, they must know, understand, live in, and have the trust of the community. HIRE AND TRAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE A PART OF THESE COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT AND SERVE. Quit the trend of outsiders coming in to police a neighborhood they have no connection to, no affinity for.  3: While I understand this change would help alter focus from reaction to prevention, I do still think it is important to have the Peace Officers superficially resemble 'police' as we know them today. While training, means of operation, how armed they are, and even who they are is going to drastically change, It is important to know that there is a powerful line of defense to deter organized crime. Many people are asking what the MPD will be replaced with, and I think it is important to stress that this kind of presence will not entirely disappear. Perhaps retrain current officers on a new Peace Officer Curriculum that is intensive, trauma-informed, deconstructs unconscious bias, and actively dismantles systemic racism in public safety. WHEN CHOOSING WHAT OFFICERS TO RETRAIN AS PEACE OFFICERS, EXAMINE THEIR RECORDS EXTENSIVELY! Anyone who shows a history of repeated misconduct or racism is PROHIBITED from retraining as Peace Officers. They are not safe for BIPOC and should not be in this line of service.  4: Implement continued, thorough, and EXTENSIVE training for Peace Officers. Current requirements for becoming a police officer are embarrassingly low. Bias training should never end, and should be continually refreshed and required for all officers, especially non-BIPOC officers. Include in the ongoing Peace Officer training history of systemic racism (red-lining, especially) so all personnel understand how systemic racism has throttled these communities for generations.  Thank you all so much for your time, energy, and dedication to this change. Your work on this is revolutionary, and it is because of you, the City Council, that we are starting to see the change we need to ensure the safety of everyone in our community. Thank you for taking this big step, and I am proud of the work you have done."
"6/30/2020 4:26:37 PM",-9,"","","The police department needs more training and recurring training in handling aggressive situations. They need to know that the police chief, the mayor, city council members, will back them up in these situations until it has been reviewed. The police need to be in the community, helping people, organizations that are striving for a better community. Police are not the bad guy. I am sure there are some bad actors, and unfortunately with a union they are allowed back to work. We need more police in our city. It has become crime and murder ridden."

As a Minneapolis citizen, I have lost confidence in the ability of the MPD to be reformed; the city needs to try a new approach. The Police Chief is an honorable person, and many of the officers are undoubtedly excellent, but there is an organizational history that appears to be impossible to overcome. I would support having current officers be able to apply for a new public safety force, but the role of the Police Union needs to be changed. Too many problematic officers have been retained or reinstated. I would also support a law/rule that officers must live within the city. Officers must know and respect the citizens they are entrusted with safeguarding."

The neighborhoods will become the wild west and people will start defending themselves, which I don't completely disagree with, but there has to be a police force so the criminals know that they cannot do whatever they want with impunity. The city council should be ashamed of themselves, as should the Governor, Mayor, Police Chief, and the Commissioner of public safety.

Or will my hand then be a target for a rubber bullets? Everytime I showed my hand, it was uncontrollably shaking from fear. Not long after I knealt down, I felt something hit the front of my sign and tear gas began to go off near me. As we all began to ran from the gas, other protesters came to aid my burning eyes, nose and throat. Not the police, the community.  The day before at another protest, my boyfriend had just arrived at the 3rd precinct. I immediately noticed the police in full riot gear on top of the roof aiming guns at us. I will admit, I gave one of them the middle finger. Not 5minutes after arriving, a concussion grenade was fired directly at my head. Luckily, I turned and guarded myself at the last second. The concussion grenade bounced off of my shoulder blade seconds before exploding. I was not the first person that day who had projectiles aimed at their heads. Either the entire force at the 3rd precinct that day has terrible aim, or they we're aiming directly for our heads. Either way, their actions needed to be addressed. They were not.  I have lost all hope and trust in the MPD. There are many other professions that deal with potentially harmful people (ex. Those in the medical field) that are much for skilled at harm reduction and deescalation. The MPD needs to be replaced with a communiry-driven team that is properly equipped and trained to deescalate and give medical aid as needed."

Lets let the police department work with options as to how they could deal with some of the situations internally.  This should be the first step.  Community outreach via the police department/liasons would be the next to find out where their time/resources could be better spent.  The majority are there to protect and serve.

While I agree that change is needed in the way that we hold bad-cops accountable, I am baffled by the idea of removing the police department completely. Those that I have heard advocating for dismantling the police often point to the need for proper mental health responses. While I'm sure there is room to create a more holistic approach to crime prevention - I believe this focus ignores the existence of violent crimes that are increasing in our neighborhoods.  We need a strong and decisive response to people that are intent on doing harm to our neighborhoods. Otherwise they will be emboldened and the greatest harm will be done to those that are least able to defend themselves.

My center was looted and turned upside down on May 28th due to the rioting and direct lack of leadership from our city leaders who should have stopped the destruction in its tracks before our beautiful city was destroyed.  I have many concerns with the proposed charter amendments. I also believe it is hypocrisy that Lisa Bender and other members of the Minneapolis council can defend the cost and need of their own personal security protection but believe a whole city should face a different set of lawlessness and a recommendation to call a neighbor or social worker if faced with a violent offender or crime. I have faced firsthand what it looks like when a crime is being committed and no one will come to help.  I am thankful both my parents who raised us in this area were not alive to see what the lack of leadership looks like at the end of a one week period. This beautiful and vibrant city definitely required improvements but it should not have come at the cost of lost businesses, horrible destruction, large scale theft, destruction of low income housing, many jobs and so many economic hardships to small businesses who were going to reopen after the temporary closures due to Covid 19.   I absolutely agree that the murder of George Floyd mandates changes and improvements. I have disagreed with many of Mayor Frey's decisions and actions but have pasted his response to the elimination of the Minneapolis police department comment below, which I agree with 100% and hope that most people understand we are not prepared in this city to eliminate the hard working men and women of the Minneapolis police department. They need training and additional support to perform their jobs to the best of their abilities. We the community and leaders are just as much to blame as the Minneapolis police department for this terrible set of circumstances. Hopefully we are all up to the challenge of becoming the city I thought we already were.  “We also need to stay focused and press for changes to state law, engage community and undertake meaningful reforms to help Chief (Medaria) Arradondo – and officers who are committed to his vision – shift the department’s culture,” Frey said. “It’s hard, complex work – and we can’t pretend that eliminating the department is a serious substitute for that hard work.”"

Especially considering that certain council members, as recently as December 2019 were advocating for the hiring more police officers than Mayor Fry was requesting (double the amount, in fact). She's my council woman and will not be receiving my vote in the next election. When you're willing to turn around that sharply on an issue, I do not trust you to act in the best interests of our city.

And if they have killed anyone in their police time they should be fired or at very least be fired if they have killed multiple because it shows they do not know how to deescalate a situation well enough for the job. And if they have had any felonies ever they should not be allowed on the force.

I'm all for reform and overhaul of the MPD and officers and getting a better police force in place.

"6/30/2020 4:44:55 PM",2,"","","As a Minneapolis homeowner, I fully support this charter amendment. I am angry, appalled, and ashamed that not only did four Minneapolis police officers torture George Floyd to death, but they did it on the clock, their salaries for murder paid by my property taxes.  As a middle-class homeowner in a nice neighborhood, I of course want to have a police force to help protect me, my family and neighbors, and my property. I want a police force that enforces the laws equally, justly, and mercifully, recognizing the human worth of every person they encounter. But the Minneapolis Police Department, in its current incarnation, is not that police force. And I do not believe they can become that police force.  I believe it is time for radical reform of the police in Minneapolis, including abolishing MPD entirely and replacing them with a new, much smaller force (or multiple forces), with a more focused mission and a great deal more civilian oversight and control. Money currently spent paying police to do a bad job at things they aren't trained to do and shouldn't be doing is money that could be spent on unarmed public safety professionals who will do a far better job.  But that sort of radical reform cannot be done within the constraints of the current charter, which mandates a minimum force size of over 700 officers. Without a change in charter, real reform is impossible. Any changes will be merely cosmetic.  I have been listening to ""reform"" since the death of Jamar Clark nearly five years ago, and five years of ""reform"" just led us to police torturing a citizen to death, my neighborhood in ashes and ruin, and countless violations of the Constitution, the Geneva Convention, and basic human decency by the police against anyone who dared speak up in the streets about police violence. I do not believe that the MPD that continues to elect Bob Kroll as their representative is ever going to negotiate in good faith for the good of the city and the citizens. They are a danger to public safety and need to be eliminated, for the good of the city.

The term ""non-law enforcement"" could mean either (a) never had any law enforcement experience or (b) has experience beyond only law enforcement. I assume (b) is the intent, but I suggest clarifying this point so the charter doesn't inadvertently exclude candidates with some law enforcement experience. The current charter provides specific, minimum funding for the police department. This revised charter is silent on the funding amount. I wonder if it makes sense to document a funding expectation for this department. I recognize that the scope of this document is limited to the charter and as such is not specific on what the Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department does, how it is structured, how staff are qualified and hired, etc. At the same time, I think the Commission needs to offer a vision for how this department will operate before and as the public is asked to vote for or against this charter revision.

I believe that the move to abolish the MPD and establish an alternative department based on community safety and holistic security practices is a vital step towards undermining systemic racism in this state and country. I also believe that this move cannot be done halfheartedly or without serious specific questions answered and would like the city council to very publicly address the following questions/concerns as they move towards November. 1) How will parts/pieces of the MPD be integrated into this new department? The valuable experience that some members of law enforcement have in dealing with intelligence and violent crime should not be discarded in my opinion but I would like to know what the plan will be for incorporating certain sections of MPD as advisors/trainers or for handling contingency scenarios like a mass shooting or hostage taking.  2) How integrated will this new department be in the community support and watch networks that have already existed or have developed during the protests and riots that followed the murder of George Floyd? There's a robust network in both Southside and Northside neighborhoods that already performs some of the duties that the hypothetical department will perform, but whether or not they will continue to function independently or will be integrated into the new department is unclear. 3) What sort of oversight boards will exist for this department? One of the fundamental tenets of a new security force should be that an effective oversight structure should exist to prevent incidents of abuse and murder like those that have marked the MPD's history. I personally would want to see both a city-funded oversight committee as well as an independent civilian review board.  I think those three pressing questions are going to figure prominently into peoples' thoughts as the vote draws nearer and elections in general draw nearer. If these questions cannot be answered or are not answered effectively, a vote in favor of abolition will be less likely."

"6/30/2020 4:46:38 PM",-2,"","","Hello - I believe the idea of reallocating police funds and reforming the department is necessary. I’m very interested to get more information about the Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department.  Things to consider and not overlook in my opinion include:  1) The recent increase in violent crime seen by Minneapolis. Has there been research done on what has caused this? What has happened in other cities that have defunded police? Has violence lessened, increased, or stayed the same?  2) White flight. While unfortunate, this country has a history of middle-upper class white people packing up and moving to the suburbs when city life gets harder. If you remove the police force and it leads to lower levels of safety (or even the feeling of less safety), many Minneapolis residents may opt to move out of the city. Especially since companies are moving to more flexible work from home arrangements - so living close to downtown might be less necessary. How will you convince the white middle/upper class to stay? Their taxpayer dollars are important.  3) Could there be a negative impact on poorer communities? It’s my understanding that areas like North Minneapolis already have trouble getting ahold of the police in certain times of need. People with more wealth can upgrade their security systems, build fences, etc. Will the new Community Protection Department have the resources to handle violent crime and keep all communities safe?  Lastly, I think it’s important to note that the phrase “dismantle the police department” (often used by city council members) sounds scary to a lot of people. I understand that the city council is looking to please a group of people who are incredibly (and rightfully) angry over George Floyd’s death, and that the strong language of “dismantling the police” accomplishes that. But to get any traction with this idea, you need to make sure people understand it’s a repeal and replace, not just a repeal. Consider softening the language and remember you represent everyone in this community. Figure out ways to bring people together on this issue instead of pushing them apart.  I look forward to seeing where this initiative goes! Thank you!"

They started the systematic round up of Jews, Romanis, everyone who was not of sound body or mind, perverts (their term, unless they were SS), nonGermans, African or mixed race people, Christians and others who refused to obey their War on the world.  They did away with municipal courts and took away everyone's rights and freedom. They Tried to destroy history and past heroes and Statesman. They got so far so fast because the rich grandparents of the people we refer to as Globalist throughout history illuminati invested money in Hitler's NWO like is being invested in our UN NWO. Same name, came evil. They bought, framed or indoctrinated the young with lies and promises they never intended to keep. And it is happening again in Minneapolis and endanging everyone in the Twin Cities. You are not modern or kinder or cleverer than the system you selfishly are destroying. You don't follow rules or laws and open the city up to much smarter, meaner and more evil takeover.  UN is two faced. One face says things we all would like to see but they have no power. The UN NWO gets their money by trafficking humans, drugs, weapons, adrenochrome in the countries they are sent to help in disasters and caste warfare.

It is not to late to repent and atone and remember the extra blessing you have had living in MN where refugees and immigrants have been welcomed and allowed to become citizens and participate in the joy of helping neighbors who want to live in a Constitutional Rebublic and then help go after those who hate us and want to destroy us for our humanity and freedoms, the elite Globalists and their minions. It is a Thin Blue Line of hardworking dedicated trained policeman who never wanted to be Militarized by the Globalist minions after 2003 that allow us to peruse our dreams and live good long lives.

Get rid of the Police and watch people leave in droves. Along with the people will be businesses. Do you honestly want to lower housing values?

I do believe some folks believe that removing the Police is a good idea, but I feel the silent majority agrees with me, in that we do need Police. I do agree that at times the Police have to much to do and we could stand up an additional department of some sort to help out with petty situations, but when violence and people's lives are at stake, we need the Police force. Without Police, people will be free to act in ways that do a disservice to this city and others, all because they know there are no consequences. As I tell my children, there will always ALWAYS be authority in their lives, and they need to respect authority. Disbanding the Police is so childish and is not teaching our children anything good. It is teaching them that if they do not like something or it is hurting people's feelings that they should in turn revolt and try to take down whatever is causing them hardship or fear. Instead, what we need to explain to everyone is that people of authority, at times, will take advantage of their authority and misuse it.

"6/30/2020 4:49:16 PM",2,"","","Concerns with proposed amendment: - Council rushing the amendment process to get something on the ballot this year without sufficiently explaining urgency of the specific changes contemplated in the amendment  - Insufficient explanation of why a name and organizational change is both requisite to achieve the underlying necessary changes, and why they are required to be rushed through  - Subordinating powers from the city-elected mayor to the ward-elected councilors including council self-selected officers turns critical public safety, violence prevention, and policing into political issues rather than decisive leadership with clear chain of command.  The existing charter language already allows for appropriate council input and oversight relative to the roles of the mayor and chief. - Term limits are not provided for the 2 new roles proposed in the amendment.  This results in less accountability for these new leaders as political appointees with potentially lifetime jobs. - Proposed amendment says council “may” employ law enforcement/peace officers.  This is not an appropriate situation for a major city such as Minneapolis.  Law enforcement is requisite for a municipality that intends to have laws.  Peace officer requirements and language ensures proper anchoring to state law. - Removal of “Public Health,” “Temporary Police,” and “Fire Police” clauses without adequate replacement in the proposed charter language leaves the city at risk of unclear direction, unclear chain of command, and ineffectual operations in crisis and emergency response incidents.  The Council has clearly rushed to put together this proposal and have clearly exercised haste over thoughtful consideration of the impacts and implications of the proposed changes. I don’t think any resident of our great city disputes the need for change to policing practices, procedure, and operations in the city of Minneapolis.  This proposed amendment does not effectively achieve those necessary changes.  This is a rushed, haphazard, organizational and name change while leaving clear vulnerabilities with regards to the functions stricken from the charter, along with obfuscating the chain of command and turning critical public safety functions into political positions subject to the whims of the council.   We’re all in this together - the council ought to work thoughtfully and deliberately with all stakeholders to ensure the changes we ultimately make as a city are truly the best plan with efficient and effective implementation.  This amendment fails at achieving the outcomes our city needs."

I hope that the police the city does keep can be held accountable to the community for their actions instead of protected by their unions while taxpayers are forced to pay out large settlements for their misdeeds. I hope this work can be led by the communities of color who are not currently protected or served by the MPD.

(It is interesting to note that nearby suburban PD's are offering ""bounties"" for new Officer hires running $2500 to $5000!)  Sure hope I don't need 911 any time soon! The Mayor and Chief Arradondo should manage P.D. - not a committee of 13 with no clear vision of policing.  We, as residents and businesses of the City have the right to expect trained police personnel in sufficient numbers to keep us safe 24/7/365! This is not to diminish the importance of social programs, which are truly necessary - but, in combination with effective professional policing.  Anything less, I would expect a decline in the livability of Minneapolis.  Already, I have had a neighbor of 17 years tell me they are moving out of the City due to City Council actions.

We need folks who are actually from and for our communities to be the ones taking care of each other. The key word here is care. We also have an incredible opportunity to make a model of ourselves for the rest of the country. To be frank, regardless of what happens we have a spotlight on us. There is tremendous pressure to do this effectively. And we can. If you insist on simply replacing the police, we will inevitably fail. We cannot possibly succeed under the same framework that has caused incalculable terror. So how do we do this? Mechanics who patrol the city with spare parts (compressed air, spare tail lights, extra fuel, etc) could be paid by the city to offer roadside assistance.  We need to expand our scope of resources and accessibility to those experiencing homelessness. We could fund more soup kitchens, learning centers for kids and adults, and food shelves.  We could invent a sort of Uber-like system for anyone who needs a safe ride across the city. No questions asked.  Free towing services Free parking city-wide  Free child care Fund programs to help parents who have been targeted by CPS.

I think it's important to note that there is a big risk of the CSVPD becoming a renamed or reformed MPD. This is not what organizers have been calling for. This new organization should have little to no similarity to the MPD in terms of structure or goals. A couple of things: - The CSVPD should be 100% demilitarized. No lethal force and no weapons. This, for me, is non-negotiable. If employees are allowed to enact violence with the backing of the city (and on the taxpayer's dime), then it is no different than the MPD.  - CSVPD employees should not be former police officers. Leadership positions should be given to abolitionist organizers who have led the movement to defund the MPD.  - The CSVPD should recognize that crime is a construct created to oppress and marginalize BIPOC. Most ""crimes"" do not hurt anyone. If no one is being hurt, then no one should be criminalized for their actions. This should be a founding principle of the organization. - The CSVPD should not criminalize homelessness, public intoxication, erratic behavior, and all other non-violent ""crimes"" with no victim.  - Employees should be trained in harm reduction, conflict de-escalation, trauma sensitivity, and active listening.  - Employees should be members of the community where they work. The demographic makeup of employees should be similar to the demographic makeup of the communities themselves.  - Part of the funds diverted from the MPD should be used to purchase hotels or apartment complexes for homeless people to live in for free, with no strings attached. The Department should provide meals and medical treatment to residents, should they want it, also with no strings attached.  - The CSVPD should not be a single department. It should be a network of departments, each with their own specialized training (mental health/suicide prevention, domestic violence/victim support, administrative/insurance reports, etc).  Most of all, though, I ask that the Commission recognize the labor that has been done by Reclaim the Block, Black Visions Collective, and other BIPOC abolitionist organizers. Honoring their work means centering their demands, even if you don't personally agree with them, or if you don't see any point in them. If this Department is created without the full support of the aforementioned organizations, then it is not what people organized for, and it isn't what people want."

The City should maintain the current City Charter, whereby the Mayor manages the Minneapolis Police Department. Reform of policing, including intensive training, retention of quality officers and expulsion of bad officers led by our Police Chief with broad-based community support should take place.  Reinforcing of best practices in the field such as CompStat, highly responsive, data driven policing making the department and its leaders more accountable, and the Broken Windows approach, where being attentive to and addressing quality -of  -life offenses and low level crime, that if left unattended becomes the invitation to higher level and more frequent crime. Attached article: Why We Need the Police They save lives and keep New York City safe for all residents—especially the most vulnerable. Heather Mac Donald June 8, 2020 New York Public safety “How lovely when we see the police! They are my friends.” So said an elderly lady attending a police-community meeting in the Bronx several years ago. Her voice is representative of the thousands of senior citizens, middle-aged workers, and small-business owners who fervently support the New York Police Department. These vulnerable New Yorkers want more police presence, not less; they view officers as their only protection against predation. What will the activists seeking to defund the NYPD tell these law-abiding residents—that they are now on their own? The people who live in high-crime neighborhoods understand more about policing than the anti-cop agitators. Since the early 1990s, when the homicide toll in New York City topped 2,000 per year, tens of thousands of lives have been saved, thanks to the NYPD’s highly responsive, data-driven policing. That policing model, known as Compstat, holds precinct commanders ruthlessly accountable for crime in their jurisdiction; it has driven homicide down 86 percent from 1990, to only 319 in 2019. Most of the lives saved by suppressing crime since then have been black and Hispanic. At the same time that the department has lowered crime to levels that would have been viewed as unimaginable three decades ago, it has radically cut its use of lethal force; the NYPD has among the lowest per-capita rates of officer shootings among big-city departments nationwide. In 2018, the most recent year for which full data are available, NYPD recorded the lowest number of shooting incidents since records were first kept in 1971—35—and the lowest number of subjects shot and killed: five. Four of those suspects were threatening officers with guns or knives; the fifth, reported as being armed by bystanders, pointed what appeared to be a gun at the responding cops. New Yorkers who live in gang territory still fear lawlessness, however, and implore the police to bring order to the streets. At the 41st Precinct in the South Bronx a while back, residents complained repeatedly about large groups of youth hanging out on corners. “There’s too much fighting,” one woman said. “There was more than 100 kids the other day; they beat on a girl about 14 years old.” A middle-aged man asked: “Why are they hanging out in crowds on the corners? No one does anything about it. Can’t you arrest them for loitering?” These citizens know that violence can erupt out of street chaos. A 2015 Quinnipiac poll found that 61 percent of black voters in New York City wanted the police to “issue summonses or make arrests” in their neighborhood for quality-of  -life offenses, more than white voters asked the same question. Back at the 41st Precinct, the president of a local mentoring program begged for a police watchtower in his neighborhood. Whenever he hears gunfire, he said, he runs toward the shooting, terrified that one of his three children has been struck. If the police go away, these law-abiding people will feel abandoned, and rightly so. The claim that better-funded social services can deliver public safety is baseless. New York City tried that experiment for decades, and it was a resounding failure. No city spent more on welfare, yet crime continued to rise. Only Compstat policing reversed the chronic lawlessness of New York. It is equally preposterous to say that social services are underfunded. The city spends a whopping $8.2 billion on social services, constituting more than 8 percent of the city’s budget, and that sum does not include all the social workers larded throughout the Department of Education. Government workers cannot substitute for the two-parent family in teaching children discipline and self-control. When parents are absent in their children’s lives, police are the second-best solution to crime—the only other one proven to work. Fewer cops and depleted NYPD funding mean longer response times and less training. Cops who cannot get back-up quickly when confronting a violently resisting suspect are more likely to escalate their own use of force. Officers are desperate for more hands-on tactical and de-escalation training. What they don’t need is implicit-bias training, which is an insult to their intelligence and street knowledge. Supervisors should constantly emphasize the need for courtesy and respect. But police officers daily confront a degree of social breakdown that would be unimaginable to most of us, and yet they continue to believe in the good people of their community. The city should not let those people down by caving to anti-cop hysteria."

As an example, when a juvenile was sexually assaulted at the Powderhorn Park tent encampment, the suspect was (and continues to be) shielded by those running the operation.  It took the emergency department staff (mandatory reporters) to file a police report.  There is no justice for the juvenile.  There is no peace for the community.  Bad cops need to be vetted, but it is crazy to say we don't need police.  People are living in fear."
"6/30/2020 5:08:42 PM",3,"","","Good Afternoon Charter Members, I want my voice to be heard! I stand behind the decisions put forth by the City Council last week. I have read the submitted revisions and stand behind Andrea Jenkins!! I demand you all listen to her voice as well.  A new system is necessary in order for our communities to thrive. I want to see total acceptance of our relatives of color as human beings. Those whom are and have been Hurt, Murdered & treated unjustly By law enforcement and the system in general. As a white woman (who arrived in Minneapolis at 17 years old & raised my children here) I have experienced unnecessary show of force by police. Once being pulled over after my young son climbed in the sky roof of my landlord’s car, which we used when he was out of town. Someone reported that we were stealing it.  I had another of my children with us, who was a baby then. A female officer pulled us over and had her gun drawn on us. I was livid that my children were put through that. Totally unnecessary!  When our peace keeping efforts shift from violent, testosterone dependent individuals to people from the neighborhood, I imagine that incident would not have occurred. They would have known who we were!!  I will be watching diligently what happens next with the proposed revisions. In Peace and Love, Mother, Grandmother ready to fight for Justice for All."
"6/30/2020 5:09:00 PM",5,"","","I support the public safety transformation. Thank you for your work on this."
"6/30/2020 5:09:19 PM",-13,"","","Police reform should be a subject dealt with along side many other issues that are also important.  The people of Minneapolis do not want to be living through a beta test of sorts on running a major US city.  In addition to the very real and legitimate problem of police violence, there are other issues that you have done NOTHING about, such as dealing with growing gun violence in our city, homelessness, mental health, drug abuse, domestic violence, ... need me to go on?  You cannot and should not make quick and extreme decisions to appease a small but very vocal minority who can wants to get rid of police.  The message sent to the public here can be dangerous if it’s not delivered correctly and well thought-out and coordinated with the Governor, Mayor, Chief of Police, State Congress, etc"
"6/30/2020 5:10:45 PM",6,"","","We do not need to disband the police department, we need to get more officers with better training.  Most of our officers are fine, caring people who are good at their jobs.  No safety department is going to stop the gangs and drug sellers from shooting up our city. Stop and think before you make a huge mistake."

"6/30/2020 5:10:57 PM",-13,"","","The police are designed to serve and protect whiteness and wealth. They have done so exceptionally, at innumerable cost - the lives of so many. mostly Black and brown people, but no one has been exempt from their violence.  You can be on the right side of history on this, or stall and get more uprisings, riots and protests the next time they murder someone - as they absolutely will.  One pathway feels new and scary but is actually less work for you in the long run. The other is a betrayal to the communities and people you proclaim to represent.  Our will is clear.  Is yours?"
"6/30/2020 5:11:56 PM",-6,"","","I support the charter to remove our police force and rebuild as a department of community safety & violence prevention! The MPD is a violent, racist institution that has time and again proven that it's impossible to reform."

"6/30/2020 5:12:52 PM",15,"","","My comments are listed below in the attached statement. To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to voice my concern regarding the City Council’s recent attempts to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. I strongly disagree with that proposal for many reasons. First, Minneapolis is a large city with all of the benefits and downfalls that entails.  I was born and raised in Minneapolis until high school.  I then came back to go to college at the University of Minnesota and I have stayed here my entire adult life. My husband and I bought a home in the Humboldt Greenway development because I wanted to stay in the city that I loved.  We paid a great deal for our home and we loved the diversity of the area.  It was where we hoped to raise our children. In the past few years, crime has slowly increased in this area.  Most of the issues are “livability” crimes such as car break-ins, garage thefts, stolen packages, excessive fireworks all summer long.  All things that while not ideal, are somewhat expected in a big city. A couple of years ago, things changed.  One evening, a bullet came through our front window and lodged in our dining room wall.  My husband had been sitting in the living not 10 minutes prior to this.  Had he been in the same spot he had been sitting in, he would have been killed instantly by a shot to the head. Nothing was ever done about it.  I don’t know if anyone was apprehended or if anyone even cared to look into it.  I wrote my City Councilwoman at the time (Barb Johnson) and heard nothing.  Around the same time, Susan Spiller was murdered in her own home just a few blocks away from us.  The murder went unsolved for years.  One afternoon not long after the murder, my husband was working in the yard when he saw a man jump the 6 foot fence in our neighbor’s yard.  My husband confronted him and he ran.  We called 911 and they never showed up.  This was mere weeks after a murder in the neighborhood. Over time, I have felt less and less safe in my neighborhood and in my own home.  We are hesitant to have guests over at night and never in the summer months because we hear gunshots on a semi-regular basis.   Keep in mind, I have never in my life heard a gunshot until recently. At the same time, I absolutely believe that the culture of the Minneapolis Police Department must change.  Bob Kroll and the Minneapolis Police Union are toxic and do nothing to benefit the citizens of this city. My husband and I strongly support BLM.  We are progressives who also respect GOOD, honest law enforcement.  We know they exist.  But we also know that there is an enormous problem with systemic racism, bias and unfair treatment to people of color. Police officers should not be mental health workers and we agree that different types of situations call for different types of responses.  But abolishing the police department is wrong.  Its short-sighted, reactionary, unsafe and not what the majority of Minneapolis citizens want. I want change.  Serious, significant change.  But when a bullet flies into my home, I want a police department to respond, act and apprehend the person who fired the gun. If someone is breaking into my home, I want a police officer.  I want decent, fair, unbiased police officers who are invested in our community. This shouldn’t be an “either-or” proposition.  I can stand up and support police reform, stand in solidarity with people of color, speak out against police brutality and still believe that we need police officers. I believe that Chief Arradondo is the right person to oversee the department, but he needs the support of the City Council, the Mayor and the city itself. Let him do his job.  Give him the resources he needs to keep Minneapolis safe and the authority to fire police officers who will not be part of the solution. I implore those of you in charge to listen to ALL sides of this argument and respect what we are all saying. Work with organizations such as A Mother’s Love Initiative, Mad Dads and others who are actually OUT THERE in the real world, seeing the impact of crime in our beautiful city. My husband and I want to stay here.  We want to be proud of where we live.  We want our brown and black neighbors to be safe, respected, heard and treated the same way that we are treated. We also want to be safe. How do we achieve this together? Thank you for your time."
"6/30/2020 5:12:59 PM",2,"","","I fully support defunding and disbanding the Minneapolis police department. We need something different. Built from the ground up."
"6/30/2020 5:13:03 PM",-6,"","","It is absolutely vital that we re-imagine the entire concept of law enforcement in our city. The Minneapolis Police Department has been terrorizing our streets for decades, my father Ruben Armendariz saw this first hand during his short foray into law enforcement in the early 90's. While this is a multi-headed beast one of those that needs to be removed is Bob Kroll.  Brutal intimidation and abuse has been his M.O. which started back in the 90's again seen first hand by my father. We need to remove the massive PD budget and distribute it so that we take on a helping role. Decriminalizing drug possession and homelessness and instead of locking them away, helping them find safe housing and the tools to learn and work and grow. To love their community that helped them versus cursing those that beat them.  This is a vital moment in our history as a city. I urge you to remove the Police Department from the charter to allow for this re-imagining. Employing civil servants that can help the community in specialized ways(mental health etc), with a very specific and highly trained group that has access to firearm usage when it comes to violent crime. With healing our community, we still must protect it from violence. Violence won't just disappear. Bias training, de-escalation training, community-centric BIPOC recruitment and incentivizing will be vital, keeping BIPOC voices heard throughout this process will be crucial to this improving our community.  Thank you for your time"
"6/30/2020 5:13:06 PM",-2,"","","I'm not convinced that it goes far enough in dismantling systemic racism, but I hope it's a step in the right direction."
"6/30/2020 5:13:40 PM",2,"","","It is of utmost importance that this city sets an example for the rest of the country as to what is truly possible in community reform. Our police department is ineffectual at best and lethal against its citizens at worst. There is an incalculable wealth of data, insight and community plans for implementing a defunding or abolishment of the police force. We can not argue that this is insurmountable or just too hard. Communities across the country and the globe have risen to this challenge, and we too must rise to it. We can look as far as European nations where the majority of police forces are not armed with lethal weapons, or look right at home where local community action is keeping residents safe by mere presence and compassion. Look no further than groups like MPD150 for thought out plans for how to truly implement this. It is possible, doable and so so so necessary."
"6/30/2020 5:14:44 PM",-3,"","","I am NOT supportive of the charter amendment to remove the police department.  I am seriously concerned for the safety of Minneapolis if this takes place."
"6/30/2020 5:15:04 PM",-1,"","","Please reconsider this proposal.  A lot of people in my community are very worried and scared about the idea of the police being removed from the city. We understand that there is a systemic issue at hand and that needs to be address. That does not mean the answer is eliminating the police. I beg you to listen to your residence. Go into North Minneapolis and actually talk to those residence about what their stance is on the idea of them no longer having the ability to call on the police as the gun violence continues to intensify in that community. I am asking for you to truly think about a city where there a no police. Where has that worked? You cannot recall Camden, NJ because they have a police force. They saw what was happening and decided to build from the ground up. That is possible here if we do this right. I implore the council to please leave Linden Hills or wherever their fantasy Minneapolis is and take a ride along with a police officer. Actually listen and understand what a night on duty is for them. Understand what changes needed to be made based on your experience not from you biased ideas of everyone being good in this world. We know you are finding this out due to the security you are making the tax payer pay for now. So I beg you to listen and understand your residence. We are trying really hard to do that and I would expect the same from the people representing us. I love Minneapolis and I hope you have a good day."
"6/30/2020 5:15:41 PM",4,"","","I would like to see a vast majority of officers unarmed. When you have a tool you feel more inclined to use it even if it’s not needed. Officers responding unarmed to a vast majority of calls will still be able to effectively enforce the laws while dramatically decreasing the chance of the murders of unarmed black men and women"
"6/30/2020 5:16:23 PM",-17,"","","I don’t think the Minneapolis Police department should be dismantled. I agree that we need to make a lot of changes in training, holding bad cops accountable, not letting the union protect bad cops. I don’t see how a Community Safety and Violence Protection program is going to keep me and my family safe. Since COVID when the police were not able to investigate gang crimes, our garage was tagged for the first time since living in Minneapolis (going on 12 years) and we constantly hear gunshots. Who is going to monitor the gangs and who is going to respond when my house is broken into and my family is upstairs sleeping? If this goes through then the state or city of Minneapolis needs to change their laws so a person can defend themselves in their own homes. I also will be shooting back at anyone that shoots at my house. If you want a bunch of vigilante neighborhoods, that is what you are going to get. This is a very BAD idea. Everyone on the city council today is responsible for doing nothing and letting bad cops get away with murder. The blood is on your hands and everyone else who sat in office and let the violence to the black community continue. Now after this you finally want to do something but take it to extreme measures. Just resign so we can elect people who will actually do something and make a difference."
"6/30/2020 5:16:58 PM",-3,"","","Law and Order are the only ways we can keep our city safe. Instead of trying to manipulate us in to believing that this will be a softest approach to policing, require law and order first. Too many out there are playing with you all. Fear and threats should never be the reason we change laws."
"6/30/2020 5:17:07 PM",-6,"","","Individuals from the homeless encampment have been wandering over to one of my houses a couple of blocks away from Powderhorn Park and using my hot tub in the middle of the night. Please don’t dismantle the police department because I really don’t know who I would call about this problem. You cannot dismantle an essential service without having in place first an alternate plan that you know works at least as well as the one you have deemed broken. Please don’t force me to install barb wire, cameras, flood lights, and potentially a fire arm. At least if you do, how about reducing my property taxes by the amount these items cost me. I can mail you the receipt. Or perhaps a member of city council can stand guard in my back yard, with their security envoy."
"6/30/2020 5:17:56 PM",5,"","","I fully support this amendment that abolishes the Minneapolis Police Department. There's no reason we should have such an inflexible city charter that makes it impossible to make actual changes in the way we approach public safety. I truly, truly hope that this process of amending the charter doesn't drag on as it did in 2018, and that we can actually vote on this amendment in the fall."
"6/30/2020 5:18:09 PM",1,"","","I do not support dissolution of police dept as it is proposed in this amendment.  I do support reform and restructure.   I believe we need a police presence and am not comfortable with the wording that makes peace officers an optional part of the plan.  At the very least, police/peace officers should be part of the ""active plan"" when it comes to the community safety & violence prevention dept."
"6/30/2020 5:19:09 PM",-10,"","","To put it simply, those who own property, live in, and do business in Minneapolis pay a lot of money in taxes with the expectation that when we call 911 police will respond, streets will be maintained, and that we will be able to conduct our business, the cities leadership has made it more expensive to live here, harder to find housing, and did not do enough to stop those doing harm, as someone who lives in a low income neighborhood, I know it will take years to replace the businesses and property lost.  There is still roofs with tarps from the 2010 tornadoes on the Northside.   Prosecute the officers that failed Mr. Floyd and invest in additional training and resources for the police. Do not waste money recreating the wheel for something that may not work and puts the whole city at risk."
"6/30/2020 5:20:40 PM",-1,"","","Though I’m sympathetic and thinks racism needs to be eradicated in MSP, there is not enough time to form a plan. You haven’t given the public anything else. I’ll be voting to not abolish"
"6/30/2020 5:20:51 PM",-1,"","","While I am glad that this proposal is being put to the people of Minneapolis by the way of putting it on the ballot for November, the City Council's proposal needs further work before it can be implemented.  While the death of George Floyd was a terrible tragedy, the City of Minneapolis needs to really really think what will happen to the city if the police department is dismantled.  The city pretty much would go into anarchy.  People of all colors would feel less safe here in Minneapolis if the police department was dismantled.  I understand the city council has the majority to disband it, but they have to really really really think how in the heck are people going to be safe in this city if it is dismantled."
"6/30/2020 5:21:21 PM",10,"","","I am strongly in favor of the proposed charter amendment. As a homeowner in South Minneapolis I believe my family will be safer without the police. I believe my neighbors will be safer without the police. I am hopeful and enthusiastic about what a Community Safety & Violence Prevention Department could look like, as long as it is truly different from the MPD, has no ties to police unions, is adequately funded, and is orchestrated by and held accountable to people of color. I look forward to seeing this question put to the voters!"
"6/30/2020 5:21:40 PM",3,"","","As a longtime resident of the Kingfield neighborhood of Minneapolis (almost 30 years), I am writing to share my bewilderment and alarm over the Proposed Charter Amendment of the City Council. Al   though it is clear to all reasonable people that the Minneapolis Police Department needs significant change and improvement, it is absurd to suggest that the department should be dismantled.  Further, it is inappropriate to propose abolishing the department without a plan to maintain community safety.  Any proposed amendment needs to follow established procedure including the gathering of community input.  It needs to clearly provide the replacement plan.  This proposed amendment was developed in a vacuum of community input.  It does not provide a plan to maintain community safety.  It is designed to give the Council unlimited power without any accountability to the city residents.  I urge the Charter Commission to reject this proposed amendment."
"6/30/2020 5:22:14 PM",-8,"","","I will not be going to another concert, sporting event, out to eat, etc... Why the hell would you remove the police department over 1 horrible cop. Just stupid.  Please keep the minneapolis police department!"

"6/30/2020 5:23:01 PM",-3,"","","PLEASE!! who's bright idea was it to even think of disbanding or refunding the police department?? Not such a bright one! I can't even imagine calling a community dept! (whatever that will consist of) people who wouldn't know what to do if there was a shooting, a rape, or any other major emergency! Maybe they'd want me to call my neighbor or my family for help and put them in danger! NEVER!! These ideas are totally ridiculous! I have a better idea! Instead of replacing the police, let's get rid of the city council and the mayor!"
"6/30/2020 5:23:50 PM",-16,"","","I do not think it is a wise idea to remove the police department, for a few reasons. First, there are many people who will be out of a job and while there are many arguments that the police is violent and police brutality, there are many more good police officers who are upholding the law, why should they be screwed for other people? Why not implement stricter rules or bounds for the officers, instead the government is just throwing them under the bus. Should we not be about rehabilitation or creating a good relationship between people and officers? Why aren't You, the government, holding them more accountable, and now you are just trying to blame the whole system, as if it isn't your faults? Nobody has tried to fix the system, this is gonna jump from one bad situation to another. Also, when there are accidents and robberies and drive by's, or kidnappings, who are people supposed to call? The safety and violence prevention club? What are they going to do? The city is going to be a lot worse off with this, more unsafe, many people will get away with a lot more crimes, but this city is pretty good at allowing chaos to rule the cities, I guess this is more up your alley..."

"6/30/2020 5:24:11 PM",-5,"","","I support abolishing the MPD by a change to the city charter and the creation of a new department of pubic safety that will be accountable and will protect all citizens equally. The MPD has proven themselves incapable of reform despite numerous attempts by mayors and police chiefs. This has lead to general dissatisfaction and the extrajudicial killings of Minneapolis citizens, primarily people of color over decades. We cannot wait for slow reform while our black and brown bothers and sisters are killed and traumatized. Defund and recreate from three ground up. There well never be justice for those killed but at the very least we must create a new structure and demand accountability"
"6/30/2020 5:24:56 PM",6,"","","MPD has a long-standing history of violence, racism, and bigotry in our community. MPD has lost the trust of the people they are sworn to protect. Numerous police chiefs have been unable to successfully make necessary changes and reforms to MPD due to Bob Kroll, the MPD Union, and a large population of police officers and lobbyists who actively work against meaningful change that supports the community and promotes peace and equality. It is clear that the only path forward is to remove / defund the MPD and start fresh with a new model. The Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department could be an effective way to achieve this, and could be the first of many steps that could bring lasting, meaningful change to our beautiful city of Minneapolis."
"6/30/2020 5:24:58 PM",-3,"","","Please don not defund the police. Criminals WILL run free knowing they have nothing to fear!"
"6/30/2020 5:25:17 PM",2,"","","The Minneapolis Police Department has proved time and time again that they are NOT here to protect its people! It is time to DEFUND the police department due to their lack of respect for citizens of their own city. Bob Kroll is a danger to society and should not be allowed to make any decisions for the police department. Instead of letting these bullies police the citizens and decide who should live or die, we should have thoughtful citizens who care about their community ready to help those in need."
"6/30/2020 5:26:18 PM",8,"","","Removing the police department would be a positive change for the Minneapolis community. Whatever changes come need to include a diverse group of community leaders, and a variety of well-paid professionals who are unarmed to assist with various things. This should include social workers, psychiatrists, professionals trained in mental health first aid, professionals trained in working with people with disabilities, and unarmed community leaders. This amendment should also put any excess money towards educational and community programs seemingly unrelated to public safety like affordable housing, shelters and long-term living situations for unhoused people, community centers, anti-racist education and training, and public assistance.  Money should also go toward scholarship funds and reparations for Black people. Investing in all of these communities will help keep them safe."
"6/30/2020 5:27:27 PM",7,"","","I strongly support the proposed charter amendment. I support the work of organizations MPD150. Black Visions Collective, and Reclaim the Block. Minneapolis must progress beyond the documented failure of reform and reformist power and into the empowerment of community through abolishment of police and incarceration as our sole models of public safety."
"6/30/2020 5:27:46 PM",-9,"","","I believe the proposed amendment would have a huge negative impact on our City.  I Believe there needs to be some kind of reform.   But to dismantle the Police would bring on complete and total mayhem.  We already have so many issues we are dealing with right now like gun violence, drugs, gangs and passenger safety on the lIght rail has also been a growing problem.  If we take away the only real protection we have from these crimes. The criminals will have free reign on all your citizens. The criminals will be committing more and more crimes without any repercussions and or any conscious. Please make the correct and sound decision on this matter.  Thank you"

"6/30/2020 5:31:27 PM",11,"","","Let me state clearly, we do not feel safe in our home or our Uptown neighborhood.  We have lost confidence in Minneapolis city management especially the city council.  We have been left to fend for ourselves while our commercial districts were burned and looted by indiscriminate parties.  Even our wonderful, multi-culti post office was not spared, burned to the ground depriving our community of daily interactions with global diversity.   Uptown has a tight community bond and had the advantage of offering residents easy, walkable access to groceries, pharmacies, etc. But now violence has significantly risen to the point where going out at night carries the real risk of being shot. We cannot allow George Floyd’s name to be just added to the ever-growing list with no real change to make all of our communities safe and peaceful with actual justice for all.  We are not looking for grand statements made with no substance, like changing the charter, which is offering no defined solution to correct current public safety, but just more words. Lack of accountability has long existed in Minneapolis but what exactly is the plan to bring just order to our city, for everyone, with details and a timeline to completion?"

That is where real reform and positive change occurs."

The handling of the innocent murders of Philando Castille, Jamar Clark, Justine Damond and George Floyd. Its clear that police departments across the country have not been held accountable for their deadly actions. Dismantling the police in Minneapolis the only logical step to reaching a community where citizens dont get killed by the people sworn to protect them."
"6/30/2020 5:34:37 PM",2,"","","Hello.  Sovereign political power holder here to encourage the idea of removing police from our social landscape.  The fact that you can talk to an “officer” about their oath of office, what it means to them, and you will be met with ignorance.  Take the power out of the role of peace officer and you have solved the problem.  POWER CORRUPTS.  Old news.  A step further is to create a social environment that encourages people to communicate with one another.  Part of scheme of racism and supremacists ideology of any kind is to separate, to divide.  Unity is acceptance of all others differences under the ideology that life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness are the only guidelines we need to make informed decisions.  People can be what they want, but hate will never have a place.  The police are the physical seesaw keeping the balance of hate in our world.  Just let go and you will see the better of all step up.  Thank you, without prejudice"
"6/30/2020 5:34:51 PM",-3,"","","You should not disband the Minneapolis Police Department. Quite frankly it would be foolhardy. I understand that the department is in need of a make over on many fronts and I am sure that they would not mind if you were to divert some of their calls to a community based team to handle prior to involving the MPD. The reason you do need the MPD is for the dangerous crimes. I believe there have been more than 1600 shots fired since this all began and quite frankly if you want real security you need a police force to handle violent crimes of which there are plenty in Minneapolis. If I am being totally honest, I do not feel same coming to Minneapolis for anything at this point in time. Typically, I visit the city of Minneapolis several times in a given year to attend Twins, Timberwolves and Vikings games in addition to at least a few music concerts at the new US Bank Stadium. I would not feel safe at many of these events without a police presence. With all that said, I urge you to please reconsider your plan of action. Find a better way than eliminating the police department. Currently, you have all of the negotiating power please utilize it wisely. Thank you."

How are you doing this right now for those who don’t use a computer or don’t feel safe identifying themselves on a site like this? Who, other than the “division of law enforcement services” would be providing services of public safety?  What is the timeline for this transition?  Who will provide public safety during the transition? What is the plan for working with current providers of public safety/service like hospitals, insurance companies who control mental health admission to hospitals, courts, schools, etc.? The phrase “Defund the Police” is creating misunderstanding, division, and opposition to this plan, however good it may be. If you want this plan to happen, this amendment to be passed, will you be willing to take the drama out and call it something else so more people will see what you are trying to do? Soon. Something that draws attention to the  actual positives in the future if this plan can go forward. In my view, leaders bring people together toward a goal. In this arena of persuasion and motivating people to vote for something new, labeling people, categorizing people, shaming people doesn’t work as well as listening, acknowledging people’s concerns, explaining, informing.  /30/2020 5:35:09 PM I support the amendment. Abolish and replace the police department. For too long Black, indigenous and other POC have been harassed, attacked and murdered by the police.

The amendment is too vague and would actually worsen the City's current problem with community safety and policing. Please stop pushing an unfinished, hurried amendment; constituents deserve more from our elected officials. The current City Council has lost the trust of many constituents and must commit to more specifics and details for all aspects of a charter amendment, before expecting citizens to vote on it."

The proposed amendment: - would eliminate MPD as a city department, to be replaced by a department that “will have responsibility for public safety services prioritizing a holistic, public health-oriented approach.” I AGREE WITH THIS POINT. - would eliminate a long-standing requirement to maintain a police force proportional to the population of Minneapolis. I AGREE WITH THIS POINT. - does not prohibit law enforcement from any specific roles. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POINT AND PREFER THAT CURRENT AND FORMER LEOS CANNOT TAKE A ROLE. - the new Department of Community Safety would have the option to maintain a much smaller police force under the control of the new Director of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POINT. Also I hope you are prioritizing BIPOC and especially Black and Indigenous voices as you review comments. I am POC (Latina) but not Black or Indigenous. I am fearful whenever I see police, including MPD. I do not trust them and they are dangerous. Mpls has tried numerous reforms in the past, such as improved training and body cameras.

I Like it or not, we are indeed a major city with major city problems.  I believe what we are seeing with our lack of control to the increased violence and public safety will turn away people who have been loyal with living and running businesses in Minneapolis which will impact the economy, quality of life and hard working nature of what we are known. I am considering moving out of state if there continues to be lack of leadership and a one track mind about solutions. It is absolutely horrific that the public’s opinion does not seem to be considered although we likely have the same end goal which is equality and positive change.

The mayor and governor are cowards and act like a step parent that goes with the flow rather do what needs to be done. I work in mpls and have seen the violence that occurs. I have watched the men and women of the police department run TOWARD gun fire and make sure citizens are safe. Since the riots have been occurring I have watch our cowardly mayors and governor ALLOW the crap to happen JUST to get future votes.

We see this playing out at lake Nokomis already with this hands off zone. Get in and do the hard work of working and supporting law enforcement and yes get rid of negligent persons.

We need peace officers who live and work in the neighborhoods they know.  We need people who can respond to robberies and to pleas for help with violent family members - to aid all concerned.  Our MPD seems to be rotting out.  It must be very difficult for those police officers who uphold justice to continue working within a system that allows fellow officers to commit crimes on the job.

The Concil can add support for peace officers, liasons, social workers, health care providers, to the City support network. These individuals work in collaboration with the City Police to support them in situations of abuse, mental health, poverty, homelessness, and more.

There are too many good men and women, of all races, in the police department, that have been a positive influence in their neighborhoods.

It is a disaster waiting to happen. It’s sad that 3 city council members who are pushing this have their own private security. If there is no need for security why have it. Have community members oversee their safety. I strongly feel that it will be very difficult for Mpls to bring in large events.

They were clearly prepared by persons who are well beyond their depth.  There is no real plan - other than a transfer of power from the Mayor to the Council.  This is a despicable and transparent abuse.  The residents of Minneapolis will rightfully demand that a detailed plan is developed BEFORE any vote is taken on the charter.

And I think we can also all agree that his death was a combination of many different factors including, but not excluding, racist police officers, not enough or bad training, the vetting of personalities that should and should not be on duty in our city and the strength of the MPD union. That being said, another missing factor is the inaction of city leadership, the City Council and the Mayor's Office, to do anything about the problem over the last 10 to 20 years. All the while knowing that there was an issue. City Councilperson, Linea Palmisano, of Ward 13, acknowledged as much when she said in a recent public statement, ""...'officer involved shootings' — didn’t just start three or four years ago."" So then, if the problem has been around for a very long time and it may or may not being caused by a number of different factors how did parts of the Minneapolis City Council, that are driving this change to the City's Charter come up with a solution in a span of couple of weeks time? How did the City Council come up with the changes needed to the Minneapolis Police Department with little or no reflection, investigation or community discussion? And given the changes asked for what is the plan? If they are asking for a change, they must have a plan. The public has heard abolish the police and defund the police? That may be the goal but that is not a plan. So what is the plan? What is the plan in detail? And will there be enough time to communicate the plan and discuss the plan and reflect on the plan before November. Or are we to believe that we should trust in the City Council when they have stood by and done nothing to this point. In my opinion, the City Council needs to get their act together. Present the plan and take the time to explain why what they are proposing is better than what we have now. If that is 6 months or a year? Whatever it takes. Or are we just going down another path that will end us up in the same place as we are now? I say no to any amendment change being put on the ballot this November."

This vicious cycle of escalating violence and tension between citizens and police can only be broken with structural change to public safety in Minneapolis, which requires changing the charter. A public health-led community safety agency is not only more desirable in the abstract; it is also a pragmatic solution that addresses the fact that the current system of policing has utterly failed to keep people safe."

You know who the criminals are and we have laws but there is no enforcement and no consequences.  The city and courts just tell the criminals not to do it again and let them back out to laugh at you and do more crime.  Why would they stop?  There are no consequences and no enforcement.  The people who are the victims of the lack of enforcement and consequences are the ones who continue to suffer every day.  We want to live in peace like the people in the suburbs do.  Please add more police and properly train them.  I can't rely on my neighbor to stop the criminals.  I can't rely on my neighbor to protect me from someone assaulting me or breaking into my property.  I can't rely on my neighbor to give me emergency medical attention.  I can't rely on my neighbor to patrol the neighborhood 24/7.  The city council and mayor need to live in North Minneapolis and then they might understand the crime and the fear we all live in 24/7.

Wasn’t it Mayor Frey’s proposal to add more police officers in the force in 2020?  In October 2019 didn’t business organizations request of the Council to add more police in the downtown areas?  It would appear we need law enforcement more than ever.   Neighborhood Watch takes on new meaning when Twin City business owners and residents are forced to defend their homes and businesses. Look at the CHOP in Seattle for wisdom.  Four shootings; two dead and others critically wounded.  Missing?  No police allowed.   Your new model of public safety? The new Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention is yet to be fully defined. Can the changes even be implemented? You ask us to put all of this power in your hands, after we waited days for our officials to quell the riot days later.  The world looks at us now as the home of the beginning of this tragedy.  They are watching us.  What will be our legacy.  Who would even want to visit a city that has no law and order?  I am against police brutality.  I am not against police.

"6/30/2020 5:55:17 PM",-54,"","","This amendment is in severe violation of the public safety of all people in the state of Minnesota, not just the city of Minneapolis. This is our state's major city and it deserves to be protected by a system of law and order, not citizens who are not trained in these areas to deal with the violence and misconduct that exists. Individuals should also be held accountable for creating it. Adequate funds and resources to improve our current system may be necessary but removal of our police force is dangerous and completely ineffective in maintaining law and order.  The city council should not have any power to remove necessary systems of safety from the city of Minneapolis.  They do not have the experience or the knowledge to make these kinds of decisions and as a result cannot act in the best interests of all of the people of the city or state of Minnesota. Not only will communities with high crime and violence have an escalation of the same in these areas but those communities affected and at risk will be emboldened to create further risk and violence for a city that does not have a system of law and order. Those who are living outside of the city who either work in or frequent the city of Minneapolis are also negatively affected, and will not frequent it. Our beautiful city will turn into a desolate place with little hope for improvement economically, or in the area of crime. Those who live outside of Minneapolis also did not vote the people on the city council into office nor do we believe they should have the power of any kind to be deciding these issues that affect us as much as they affect the citizens of Minneapolis. They are not trained or educated in these areas of public safety and for far too long have been operating on their own personal opinions and ideologies instead of on fact or the welfare and good of the people of the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota. Outreach in the form of discussion or therapy in the moment in a situation of violence is unrealistic and a completely ridiculous approach to maintaining law and order in our city and state. To suggest that this will be an effective means of bringing peace and unity to our great city is ludicrous, unfounded, and dangerous. When a crime is committed, we must have systems in place for accountability and safety. Outreach by someone who is not trained as a police officer when someone is in an altered state of mind, armed with a violent weapon, or waiting for an opportunity to inflict harm on another will only increase violence without a system of law and order. As a former Minneapolis resident, who lived there her entire childhood and young adult life, I am throughly disgusted with the ineffective, inexperienced, and lack of knowledgeable members that are sitting on the city council right now. Based on this proposal, they are a completely inadequate group of people with too much power incapable of using it responsibly and are wrapped up again in their own personal feelings and opinions instead of logical and reasonable approaches to peace and safety. I propose we take a closer look at our city's government versus our city's police department. Throughly afraid for the future of our state and city after the ineffective way our mayor and governor dealt with the violence in our city and our public safety. It never should have gotten to the level it did and it never should have been tolerated but instead prevented. To allow a precinct to be burned down and surrounding areas along with looting should have been prevented. You don't allow for or stand for violence anywhere, anytime. If we are going to allow violence as response to racism and respond with legitimizing it, we are no longer part of the solution but a huge part of the problem. Violence inflicted on one does not justify violence inflicted on all and both forms were from individuals breaking the law. The City Council is now putting us at greater risk for chaos and unrest not peace and unity."

In this case, the two key elements to include are the elimination of the minimum number of employees and the organizational demotion of the Police Department to be a division with a broader Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. The proposed amendment comes close to sticking to that minimum, with the most significant exception I see being the inclusion of a negative requirement on the Director of Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department. That job description, like all elements of the Charter, should be kept flexible. As such, it should specify only the essential traits the Director must have. That they have expertise in a particular area is relevant; that the expertise comes from outside a specified (sub-)area is not. As phrased, the requirement is also likely to cause contention over interpretation. Can an individual have non-law-enforcement experience if they also have law-enforcement experience? I would say so, but surely some would say the intent was to exclude at least those whose law-enforcement background predominates. As indicated previously, better to focus on the positive of what is wanted, not the negative of what is to be excluded."

Under this department, there may be a division of law enforcement which the previously mentioned proposed department would be in charge of. The key thing that has me concerned is the fact that the person leading this proposed department would not have a law enforcement background. I should also note that since the city council has to approve whomever the mayor nominates to lead this department also has me concerned. We're giving the city council more power than it already has. Also, the fact that there is a possibility of not having a law enforcement division also has me concerned in the fact that there would be even more crime than there currently is in Minneapolis. In short, it seems like the city council doesn't have a real plan. To tell you the truth, I feel that we're playing with emotions and not facts. yes what happened to George Floyd was a tragic incident that should not have taken place as far as the officer kneeling on his neck for as long as he did. It seems like that we're not dealing with the real problem. That problem is the fact that Derek Shauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, had 17 prior complaints, one of which resulted in disapline. The problem it seems that Minneapolis officers are not being held accountable enough for their actions. Rather than abolish the current police department, why not focus on the issue of how much power the union has and hold officers more accountable for their actions. I can tell you with certainty that if this proposed amendment passes, my visits to Minneapolis to attend things such as Twins games and concerts or other recreational activities that I participate in will be way less if at all. There are plenty of people who feel the way I do. If those people who also go to Minneapolis for entertainment reduce their visits not to mention places of employment leaving the city, the tax revenue will go down significantly. The majority of people would tell you that they would rather have a police department than no police at all. Rather than playing by emotions, let's take a look at the real problem which I previously mentioned being how much power the police union has and holding cops more accountable."
"6/30/2020 6:00:19 PM",3,"","","I think the decision to disband/defund/etc. The police is a completely rash decision with unpredictable consequences.  There is no doubt that reform of the MPD is necessary, this continued abuse and mistreatment of POC is unacceptable. I have lived in the Twin Cities metro area for over 15 years though, and in that time have seen a city I love and have created many memories in continue to decline. I no longer feel safe in Downtown or Uptown, alone in daylight or with my husband in the evenings. Even in areas that were once known as bustling and centers of action. As the lack of support for police has continued to increase, so has the lack of safety for residents, visitors and local businesses. I strongly encourage this board to veto the defunding/disbandment of the MPD, and look at other options for reforming them through training programs. I believe strongly in the need for improved community health programs and I know those come with a cost, but there surely has to be other areas in the cities or states budget that can accommodate for this while still ensuring all citizens regardless of race feel safe and protected.  As a side note, if the council members who are for defunding the MPD think it's such a good idea, then why are we taxpayers paying for their private security in a time when they seem to not feel safe?!"

"6/30/2020 6:02:52 PM",18,"","","Esteemed Members of the Charter Commission, I’d like to voice my approval and support for   the proposed amendment to the Minneapolis City Charter. However, I urge you to consider the following revisions as proposed by community members and activist organizations: 1) Include language in the amendment that excludes current and former MPLS cops from leading the newly established department 2) I urge the Commission to consider language that does not simply allow for a smaller police force. In the words of MPD150, “...in this long transition process, we may need a small, specialized class of public servants whose job it is to respond to violent crimes.” However, they also go onto say, “It’s important to note that that’s one option, and it’s an option that brings up as many questions as it answers. Different activists, thinkers, and communities will have different responses to these questions. How can we intervene humanely and safely in high-risk situations? How do we ensure that those people trained and entrusted to this work during the transition process do not become “police” with a different name? How might different communities be empowered to decide for themselves what they need, whether that’s AIM patrols, community mutual aid efforts, transformative justice programs, and/or governmental solutions?” In summary, I support the proposed amendment to   the City Charter and strongly encourage the language revisions above. I look forward to voting on this in November."

Chicago is gonna be sooooo jealous of you guys. Hire more cops? Pfft Idiots, all the gangs will fold before SVPD. I hear Mexico is eagerly awaiting the results of this too. Plus, Having a non law enforcement background as head that can be recommended by the major but also has to be approved by City Council? Brilliant. Surly that won’t cause any sort of resentment or inner agency conflict/communication issues. I have no programing experience but I’m gonna go demand Apple make me a Senior Programing head because I’m a Person Of Color. Of course since you all have such faith in this new department SURLY, YOU won’t be adding any sort of extra safety measures or Private Security to YOUR homes will you?

As a direct result of the city council’s incompetence my family is preparing to sell the house we love & the only house our child knows because we no longer feel safe.

My preference would be less so called “warrior” training, and greater emphasis on sensitivity and de-escalation training. I understand the feelings of council members to address this issue swiftly. However, I can only support members of the council who search for alternative opportunities to police abolition. My fear is that the neighborhoods who interact with the police department the most now will suffer the most by such action as abolition."
"6/30/2020 6:09:04 PM",-4,"","","I would not visit Minneapolis if there were no police. I would not feel safe and do not believe that a few bad apples means to just throw the entire police dept. out. I believe that you are running with this idea because you are not able to stand with the law and want to pamper these people to feel they got their way. There are rules and regulations (the law) that needs to be followed, if these residents would stop doing drugs (which Floyd had in his system), killing each other, shaking their babies, robbing stores and individuals, they would be much better residents of their community."
"6/30/2020 6:10:09 PM",-4,"","","I believe the commission should deny the City Council's proposal to amend the charter to defund the police department until a plan has been drafted that describes what the department of community safety and violence prevention will be.  Since it will take a year to get community input and draft the plan, it is not urgent to vote on defunding the police department now. It could wait until the next voting cycle.  It is plausible that many people (including myself) believe that substantial reform is needed but will vote ""no"" for the amendment because it is unclear at this point in time what an alternative department will be. If commission believes it is the best course of action to move the amendment forward, then the I believe 1) the mayor not City Council should have oversight of the new department. 2) the director should not be restricted to the people who do not have a law-enforcement background (though the director could be someone without a law enforcement background, 3) funding and total headcount levels should be maintained (though the new department could include some personnel that do not have law enforcement licenses)."
"6/30/2020 6:10:26 PM",-6,"","","No to the city council being in charge of the new police reforms.  There's already too much of their influence on things that do not get done and not enough transparency.  We need to start fresh with a citizen-based panel making the rules and doing the oversight. All police must be required to self insure against any lawsuits.  No more taxpayer money being spent on bailing them out.  We need things for our scools and vulnerable populations."

I think a tiered system of different types of officers from which a 911 dispatcher can select the best person for the job. Examples of tiers: A small Violent Crime Unit (the only armed division) Petty Crime (unarmed, no force allowed, job is to write up and fine offenses like garage break ins or midnight fireworks) Mental Health (unarmed, handles crises with drugs or people having public mental health breakdowns) The overall department will be smaller with the rest of the former MPD budget going to community building efforts supporting reduction of drug use and getting money and jobs to the citizens. This change cannot be immediate as the shock to the system could lead to problems. Slowly move funds and lay off officers hiring only the most exemplary into the new system. Officers would ideally only work within their own community."
"6/30/2020 6:10:54 PM",-6,"","","I was born and raised in Eagan.  I moved to MT in October with plans to purchase a second home downtown next year.  First you have ZERO credibility when you call to defund and dismantle the Police and go ahead and hire your own personal security.  The tax paying public can't do that for themselves.  Shame on all of you!  There is NO WAY we will be purchasing in MN unless the violence gets under control and there is a decent police force! Period.  We have been Twins season ticket holders since Target Field opened, we will not be renewing our tickets if this isn't resolved!  You are going to lose businesses, you are going to lose residents and your property values are going to plummet.  Hard working, law abiding citizens want to know they will be protected by the police and the police are supported by their mayors and city councils.  This is completely ridiculous to dismantle the police department.  A SIMPLE solution is to a) get rid of the Union President and b) review the records of EVERY cop and anyone who has 3+ complaints is fired, no questions asked, no more chances to do better.  Then you hire and train fresh new police who will do the job in an honorable fashion!  Most of my family is still in the twin cities, this is very important to me!"

It has become blatantly obvious in the past few weeks that the police system has no interest in protecting the community. On the contrary, they have been terrorizing, brutalizing, and killing the people they are supposed to serve. The MPD has been given too much of our city's budget and too much authority, and it's clear the department does not benefit the people of Minneapolis. Public safety should be in the hands of people who actually live in Minneapolis, people who actually care about helping their neighbors.

"6/30/2020 6:19:48 PM",-44,"","","This proposed amendment is too vague. Crime has skyrocketed to a level where many tax paying, business supporting residents are considering leaving Minneapolis because they do not feel that they are safe now and feel that there is no assurance that crime will be dealt with. I personally have not slept in days. Where I live there have been shootings throughout the day and night every single day. I am tired of being told that this is just normal for the northside. That the people that call the northside home should just deal with it. What I have been reading from crime reports is that this is young people that now feel that getting rid of the MPD is their license for total anarchy. I look at the proposal and it is so vague that I wonder if Anarchy is exactly what is coming. If this is not the intent they need to spell out what the new model would look like in real life scenarios. If my home is broken into do I call a social worker and ask nicely for the burglar to wait for them to arrive so we can talk about why they feel they should break in and kill my family? Because this is what the proposal sounds like to me in the way it has been presented. I do agree that we need to show the young people a future they can fight for. I agree in prevention. But I also want an assurance that there will be officers that will still handle violent crime. We cannot be lawless. I read crime reports and right now we need to bring order to chaos. Prevention should have happened the moment our governor thought about closing down the state thus ending jobs with no support for these people. Northside, our most vulnerable area. Where people were already living paycheck to paycheck. Those of us still trying to get by the best we can now living in terror because our youth have turned to other things. Our city taken hostage by a small percentage of the population.  This was coming BEFORE George Floyd! While I do believe the reason we are here today is because of systemic racism and I want to see change, I do not think allowing bullets to fly day and night is a problem that can be ignored and must be dealt with! Nobody should be afraid to leave their home. People that have lived here 20 years, paid taxes here, supported businesses here, raised family here are ready to pack up and leave. When they do who will support those businesses that employ people? This is an avalanche. It is short sighted to believe it can be ignored. What is the city going to do about that? Violence has become a pandemic of itself.  I see from crime reports that many of the shootings involve young people. How many of them will die because the city does not want to address crime? I get why this is happening. People have lost hope. They have turned to crime because it is the only thing left in their mind to turn to! If ignored too long it will be the only thing left as more and more flee the city. I love this city but the proposal does not get specific enough to win my vote for sure. Show me that violence will not be tolerated regardless of reform. People are not feeling that right now. I see you are spending our tax money on extra security for yourselves so you are feeling that right now as well! Meanwhile I wake up throughout the night to the sound of gunshots, yelling, fireworks, wondering if my family is in danger. Many in the same boat. At the moment it feels like nobody cares about the people here. Its not right. I agree in many aspects of reform. What Happened to George Floyd must never happen again. It was sickening. Racism is apparently still alive and justice must be served to ANYONE that commits murder and no an officer should not get a free pass to do what was done to George Floyd. But also NOBODY should get a free pass to run about shooting people. I am all for reform but not lawlessness. We still need police. We may need them better, but we need them. Spell it out !"

Support the first responders that have to work in potential dangerous conditions. Your group make the rules and the police have to enforce those rules. The blame starts at the top.

"6/30/2020 6:21:26 PM",2,"","","Minneapolis City Council,  There is nothing in the amendment that guarantees the public services that the City Council is promising residents of Minneapolis. The amended charter should clearly state how many employees the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention (DCS) will provide per resident. From there, the total number of DCS employees should be broken down so residents can view our rights to social workers, crisis negotiators, and whatever we decide to call the police.  There should be an additional clause attached to this amendment. The amendment must include a ban on City Council members receiving income, donations, and future employment from nonprofit and for-profit organizations associated with DCS. This request is not off topic. The new amendment gives the City Council greater control over the lives of Minneapolis residents. There should be protections in place for the citizens of Minneapolis. We have a right to know that the choices being made by City Council are not profit motivated. The Council is responsible for restoring faith in our institutions.

"6/30/2020 6:24:46 PM",-20,"","","Please see the attached comments. We would like to comment on the proposal to create a new Minneapolis Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. We generally favor this proposal but have two serious concerns with the draft ordinance: • First, the idea that it is optional for the city to have a law enforcement service is completely unacceptable yet this is exactly how the proposed ordinance is written: “The Council may maintain a division of law enforcement services.” (Emphasis added)  Law enforcement is a necessary function, not an optional one. Recent news coverage indicates that Minneapolitans across the city value and want professional law enforcement services.  The problem that George Floyd’s tragic, racist killing spotlights is not that we have a police department but that we have the wrong kind of police department. We need a better law enforcement agency, one that is charged to protect, to use force only when absolutely needed, and to do so in ways consistent with high humane and professional principles. • Second, the proposed ordinance would weaken management of, and accountability for, law enforcement. This is because the ordinance would give control of the proposed Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention to the City Council. At present, the Mayor has “complete power” over the police department. The Mayor should have the same power over the proposed new department, making the Mayor accountable for all it does. Vesting that power in the Council would subject the new department to attempted management by each Council member and would make no elected official accountable for the department’s performance.  One of the shortcomings of the current City Charter is that it makes the position of the Mayor weak because, in many areas, it allows the Council to exercise executive powers that detract from those of the Mayor. The proper role for the Council is to serve strictly as a legislative body rather than seek to insert itself into operations of City agencies. If the Council fills that role it will find that its control of City policy actually is enhanced because it will be able to concentrate on law-making and oversight. The underlined passages in the following show our recommendations for changes to the proposed ordinance consistent with these two serious concerns: Sec. 7.3. Community Safety and Violence Prevention (a) Direction. The Mayor has complete power over the operation, maintenance, and command of the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention and over its constituent divisions and other units. The Mayor may make all rules and regulations and may promulgate and enforce general and special orders necessary to operate the department. Except where the law vests an appointment in the department itself, the Mayor appoints and may discipline or discharge any employee in the department (subject to the Civil Service Commission’s rules, in the case of an employee in the classified service.) The Mayor may, in case of emergency, appoint any necessary temporary employee for up to one week. (b) Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. The City Council must adequately fund, and consistently engage with the public about, a department of community safety and violence prevention, which will have responsibility for public safety services, prioritizing a holistic, public health-oriented approach. (1) Director of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. [As in the current proposal] (b) Division of Law Enforcement Services. The Council must adequately fund a division of law enforcement services, composed of licensed peace officers, subject to the supervision of the department of community safety and violence prevention. (1) Director of Law Enforcement Services Division. The director of the department of community safety and violence prevention shall appoint the director of the division of law enforcement services, subject to confirmation by the Mayor. (2) Civil Service. The director of law enforcement serves in the unclassified service, but with the same employee benefits (except as to hiring and removal) as an officer in the classified service. If a director is appointed from the classified service, the director is treated as taking a leave of absence while serving as director, after which he or she is entitled to return to his or her permanent grade in the classified service... [Remainder as in current law] Very sincerely yours"

Decades of well-intentioned policing reforms led up to the killing of George Floyd and the unacceptable police response that followed. I see no reason to believe that any further reforms that preserve the existing structure of our police department can produce different results in the future.  I chose to make my home in Minneapolis in large part because this city struck me as a place genuinely committed to making life better for its citizens. I still believe that to be true. But it is clear that we have a vast amount of work to do to foster genuine peace and safety, and the Charter as it currently stands blocks that work from reaching its fullest potential.  I am outraged by the failures of the current system and enormously hopeful about what we can accomplish in rethinking it. I appreciate your time and attention at this critical juncture for our city."

"6/30/2020 6:31:26 PM",-6,"","","We need police to protect us when violence or crime happens. However, the current department needs to be dismantled and rebuilt. The protection these officers get for misconduct is unacceptable. Individual officers should be required to carry liability insurance like doctors and nurses do. Officers hired back after reorganization should have a MINIMUM two yr degree in either criminal justice, psychology, or other area pertinent to their role of serving the community. They should also be required to earn continued education credits every year.   Furthermore, social workers, mental health professionals, community health nurses, etc, should be available to respond to calls when appropriate. Resources should be made available so their recommendations can be followed through on. Temporary homeless housing, inpatient treatment for substance abuse, job coaching, or whatever would help prevent crime and lift people up should be implemented. We have an opportunity to make a great change, and we should seize it to improve the future of our city!"

As a clinical psychologist working with our most vulnerable populations, I implore you to absolutely not change the charter. As a former employee of Hennepin County COPE, I would encourage you to review existing programs and instead work on expanding those. Do we need major changes made to the MPD? Absolutely. Do we need police? Absolutely. I can say firsthand that those who need the police the most are the voices not being heard whatsoever. People of all races, ethnicities, and gender. The major changes needed are going to take everyone’s voices, everyone’s input. Our City Council appears to have good intentions, but are too short-sighted to see the extreme and harmful unintended consequences of their knee-jerk reactions. It would be nice to be able to see some maturity and wisdom from the Council, in the sense of making changes that have been well-planned and thought out. If you need an example of the unintended consequences of a knee-jerk reaction, look at the Park Boards decision to allow encampments in the parks, after the Park Police severed ties with MPD. There have been multiple sexual assaults on CHILDREN in the encampments, and Park Police complete their shifts around midnight, and MPD aren’t allowed to respond. Who’s protecting the most vulnerable in the parks? The same problems occurring in the parks can be, and should be, easily anticipated on a massive scale. Who will respond to violent acts? How about school shootings? Has anyone asked the mothers of kids gunned down in the past month their thoughts? I have one client whose son was recently murdered, and she is terrified there will be no police to keep the rest of her family safe. How about those actively hiding from abusers? I have many clients terrified there won’t be police to protect them from abusers. Again, these decisions need to be made swiftly, but with planning and input from everyone. The Council seems to be too far out of their league with this one, please don’t harm our residents with their ignorance!"

In the 3 years he’s lived in Minneapolis he’s been severely assaulted more than once. First time was on Erie St and second time was at Dinkytown McDonalds. Reason for assault was 1st for an old cellphone which he didn’t have on him so they beat him & 2nd was for not giving a gang affiliation. He was on his way to weekly art group mtg. when confronted & because of his dreads & looks assumed he couldn’t be a student. Both times he could have lost his life easily w/o cops I can’t & won’t encourage him risking his life in a city without cops.  Loved one in Minneapolis suffering from bipolar 1 in full mania was taken to Fairview by 2 very respectful cops w/o any incidents of disrespect & even contacted after to offer good healing thoughts. Change is NEEDED but to allow a Council to make such a drastic change isn’t it. They want it expedited, they have hired private security that city pays for but kids literally taking bullets?  I’ve thought a lot about as a mom of black adult kids in Minneapolis & honestly without more cops I can’t see my kids thriving. Easily could be a loved one if mine in Floyd’s situation & understand the anger but I wouldn’t support abolishing citizens & don’t support abolish cops. Need to find a middle ground.  I’ve attended council mtgs before the members don’t have to have power over Department to enact some changes but I feel they want it anyway, why?   I also feel that if this is the remedy the majority of Minneapolis wants the Council should be able to run for next term with that as their goal, if re-elected under those pretenses then I’d be more willing to consider it.

Additionally, I endorse  the funds set aside for the MPD  be allocated to various public health and violence prevention initiatives including, but not limited to, safe housing for the un-homed and for low income residents, violence prevention programs waiting at risk communities, jobs programs for youth, expansion of drug and alcohol treatment facilities and services, and the creation of a restorative justice program. One huge benefit would be to break up the Police Officer's Federation, which works to protect officers that violate protocol and can effectively rack up numerous brutality charges with impunity. Officer's records should be open for review by the public or by a body of citizens that can call for an officer's removal.  Officer Chauvin had 17 complaints of excessive force or brutality against him and was insulated from punishment by the Union. Additionally, I would endorse a plan for officers to carry their own liability insurance.

I look forward to reading your plans to make a community controlled department of public health and safety that differentiates the various problems we face--    from mental health, to spousal abuse, to tax fraud, housing insecurity, and violent crime--    that deserve specialized responses. I look forward to hearing about your plans to create a department focused on responding to sexual assault and abuse that believes victims and doesn't ""misplace"" rape kits. I look forward to being able to call someone qualified to help me when my friend is acting in a way that I believe will harm themselves or others due to intoxication or a mental health crisis without fearing that the respondents will only make the situation more volatile. I can't wait until BIPOC community members have people they can count on to truly work in their best interests, to protect them and help them in difficult situations, without fearing that they will be mistaken for criminals and murdered. As a city, you know that it is wrong that MPD is responsible for all of the above. They are not trained for that, and they can not do their jobs without the trust of the community they serve--    a trust that they have broken. You know that you can't just replace them with another one-size fits all solution that resorts to violence at a drop of a pin and has irredeemable roots in white supremacy. You also know that the transition, no matter how hard you try, will not go smoothly, and you will be under attacks from the media, from conservatives, from groups you haven't even considered yet.

Over the past few decades, anti-violence efforts have spread through the country to aid communities in achieving those things. 'These violence-interruption programs can be incredibly important when they are well funded, well run, and lack police interference. They can show tremendously positive results in reducing shootings and homicides,' Vitale said.

I myself have basically abandoned my post as block leader, because, why bother?  Our supposed city council representative, Alondra Cano, is always there for the photo op of being a pretty Latino woman, but she blocks our emails if we bother her too much about the actual crimes on our block.  We have not had a crime prevention specialist in the 3rd precinct for at least a couple of years now, and how is that money being spent?  Our tax payer money!  And yet a man passes a $20 counterfeit bill and gets murdered for it.  That, 911 responds to.

Some are technical, some relate to process, and some relate to what this amendment will actually do (or, more correctly, won’t do).

The proposed charter amendment would put the police department under another department that reports to a City Council committee and, for any action, to all 13 Council members.

Attachment: UNDERSTANDING THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL’S CHARTER AMENDMENT   On June 26, 2020 the Minneapolis City Council introduced a proposed charter amendment to rebrand the Minneapolis Police Department into a “Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention.”   There are many problems with this proposed charter amendment. Some are technical, some relate to process, and some relate to what this amendment will actually do (or, more correctly, won’t do).  UNDERSTANDING THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL’S CHARTER AMENDMENT  The Proposed Amendment Won’t Change Policing—Just Make it Less Accountable  The proposed amendment gives the appearance of creating a kinder, gentler version of public safety but really it just shifts power and accountability.   Under the current charter, the Mayor oversees policing, including discipline. The proposed charter amendment would put the police department under another department that reports to a City Council committee and, for any action, to all 13 Council members. The new structure means LESS direct accountability for the police department and is a DISASTER for community oversight of the police.  The City Council would have you believe they will do a better job of holding police accountable but history tells us otherwise. Council members, including the current ones, have never made the slightest effort to rein in the MPD even though they had many opportunities before George Floyd was killed. They never questioned the union contract. They blew the chance to mandate a good body camera policy when they approved the purchase before seeing the policy. And they created the Office of Police Conduct Review (OPCR), which has a dismal rate of upholding complaints against police, and they continually refuse to address its failures. Why would anyone think they would do a better job of holding police accountable under this new scheme?   Their proposed amendment creates no actual reforms in policing. Instead, it promotes the notion that policing and social services somehow belong under the same umbrella, perpetuating many of the problems the community experiences now.   The Devil is in The Details  • The city charter is our constitution. It is essential that any changes be legal and proper.  • The current Charter makes it clear that the mayor is responsible for all police discipline. The proposed amendment doesn’t indicate who is responsible for police discipline, a fatal flaw in the wording.  • Their proposed wording of Section 7.3(b) states “The Council MAY maintain a division of law enforcement services, composed of licensed peace officers...” while subd. 1 states “The director...SHALL appoint the director of the division of law enforcement services...” SHALL is a legal word that means something must be done.

A Flawed Process Creates Flawed Results  In its haste to push this charter amendment, the City Council has completely cut out any involvement of the community. The normal process for a charter amendment is for the city council to send the amendment to a committee. That committee refines the wording and holds one or more public hearings for community feedback. This time, however, the City Council suspended its own rules to avoid holding public hearings.   The proposed amendment now goes to the Charter Commission. Hopefully, this commission will do what the City Council has failed to do—address the flaws in the amendment and hold public hearings. The Charter Commission is a deliberative body—they actually take the time to review proposed amendments because they recognize the seriousness of making permanent changes to the charter. They will receive the amendment wording on July 1, 2020 and have 60 days to review it, with the option to extend that by 90 days.   The City Council seems hell bent to get this flawed amendment on the ballot for November 2020 but that would have to happen by August 21, 2020. Since this is very unlikely, the amendment will likely be on the ballot in November 2021. This begs the question—why the giant rush to push out faulty wording with no input from the public?   Keep in mind that even if a charter amendment proposal gets on the ballot in 2020 or 2021, it still has to be approved by 51% of the city’s voters. A poorly written proposal has a lot less chance of success.     What Should Be Done?  There is one part of the proposed charter amendment that would be helpful. The current charter requires the city to fund policing at .0017 x the population. That means we’re required to fund a minimum of about 730 cops (we actually have about 880 on the payroll). Yet police are being utilized for many functions that shouldn’t be approached through a law enforcement lens including mental health crisis calls, homelessness, substance abuse and overdoses, school discipline, and other societal issues. The proposed amendment removes this funding requirement, which would allow us to significantly reduce the size of the police force and shift funds to mental health crisis responders and social service agencies that would do a better job of addressing these issues.   In addition, whether or not a charter amendment ends up on the ballot, the City Council and Mayor could move forward NOW with actions to rein in the MPD and hold them accountable. They could start by dismantling the ineffective OPCR and replacing it with true community oversight of the police, including empowering the community to directly oversee the police chief and assign discipline.  There are many other actions they could take. These are not fast fixes but they are lasting ones. For a complete list, go to cuapb.org for our list of 44 recommendations on ending police violence.

Policing as we know it needs to be completely abolished and replaced with a community oriented, service-oriented, publicly accountable, professionally liable, licensed and frequently evaluated group of professionals to include mental health workers, substance abuse workers, domestic violence specialists, traffic specialists, and other qualified workers to respond in situations now assigned to the police.

If we cannot have protection of my choice (the Minneapolis Police Department), why should you?!

"6/30/2020 7:04:18 PM",-23,"","","Hello - I’m worried for the city of Minneapolis. I’m watching what is happening around the city and I’m nervous. I am not supportive of disbanding the police. I believe doing so would create a situation where the most vulnerable that we are all trying to protect from police brutality and misconduct would be most at risk and underserved. What happens in the middle of the night when someone is experiencing domestic violence and they only person they can turn to is a social worker or domestic violence hotline? In my opinion, the first answer need to center around a strong point economy with low unemployment rates, specifically low unemployment rates for minority communities. Low unemployment rates will equate to lower crime statistics.  I think we need to focus on really strong police reform. I believe Bob Kroll is unfit for his position and needs to resign. I also feel we need to re-hire the entire police force in Minneapolis - meaning additional background checks and a microscopic look at all complaints for every officer. I also feel we need to start by recruiting more Black officers into the MPD. We need to focus on programs with youth that drive them to want to serve the community in this role. I also believe the Minneapolis police force should live in the city it supports or a large percentage of the force should reside in Minneapolis. Additionally, I’m surprised by the use of taxpayer dollars to fund private security for council members. Why not practice the same message you are preaching? Or why not utilize the Minneapolis Police Department and speak with them while utilizing them for security. You may have some healthy dialogue.  I do not live in Minneapolis but have lived there for several years, work in Minneapolis and visit for recreation purposes. I’m afraid if the direction we are heading. The message to defund the police was presented with no facts, no vision and no plan. How can Minneapolis have confidence in leaders when that is how the plan is presented. Thank you"
"6/30/2020 7:05:48 PM",-4,"","","I grew up in south Minneapolis in the Fulton neighborhood. I think that Changing the charter of Minneapolis to “re-imagine” the police department might be one of worst ideas since not letting hitler into art school. Look at Detroit. In some areas the response time is 30 minutes or more. Sometimes the police are unable to respond. I believe that society does need change, this is not the way to enact that change. Maybe the mod and the park police need to be rejoined in a common goal of keeping our city safe and flourishing."

"6/30/2020 7:06:13 PM",12,"","","The proposed changes to the charter appear to be at best high level guidelines. It appears to this citizen of Minneapolis that the ordinance changes have not been ""beta staged"" with stakeholders to see if they are workable at a granular level. The amended section 7.3 uses vague non-measurable terms such as ""maintain, adequately fund, and consistently engage..."" This will definitely lead to constant tension and disagreement as each stakeholder will create her/his interpretation of these terms. The phrase ""non-law enforcement experience"" is also open for wide interpretation.  In section 8.4, there is mention of an executive committee. There is not mention of the make-up of this committee, how formed, to whom does it report? One has to look in other sections of the City Ordinance to gain a knowledge of the Executive Committee. This is a prime example of asking for engagement without adequate and easily obtained explanation or a working diagram.  Asking the public to vote on this is ill-advised in my mind, given the vagueness of the details and the lack of workability, especially as regards the reporting structure, the measureables and the monetary viability of the personnel changes. From a practical matter, there is no explanation on how the police department can be decommissioned and a new department be established and fully functional without creating a dangerous gap that will significantly endanger the populace of Minneapolis. It will be extremely difficult to educate the public as to the actual changes that will occur given a yes vote. This ordinance changes, as written, imply incredible pie in the sky  outcomes in that these new super humans that will enforce safety in the city will come with no faults, weaknesses, prejudices of ill-will, and if they do, the city will ferret them out immediately. If the city had or plans to have such insightful hiring and accountability practices, then the existing structure is as workable as the new structure and the other departments in the city would be or will be working at a world class level.  In my opinion, changing structure without a fundamental ability and  accountability throughout the system including the mayor and city council is like shuffling the chairs on the Titanic.  We are in a republic, not a democracy. We elected the mayor and the city council to lead and make the city work for all its stakeholders. Putting this charter change on the ballot appears to me to be an abdication of leadership.  The unanimous vote of the city council to put this proposed change on the ballot insinuates that there is no other workable structure or that the existing structure cannot be tailored to work. As an esteemed colleague of mine once quoted, ""Don't tell me what can't be done, just tell me what you don't know how to do'.'   This is an all or nothing change. This is a forced outcome without alternative approaches being discussed and input taken. There is no what happens if this initiative fails.   I recommend that this ordinance change not be advanced to the voting public but rather make the desired outcomes happen within the existing ordinance nomenclature and reporting structure. This will keep the public safe and also get to the desired outcomes in a more timely and safe manner.  Thank you for attention in this manner."
"6/30/2020 7:06:17 PM",5,"","","I do not support the police disbandment however I do completely support police reform. We need to ensure that the leaders of this organization are not racist bigots, we also need to make sure there is diversity in the hiring process. Adequate mental health evaluations along with enough resources and programs for police officers to engage for mental health. Rotations amongst the officers in the “bad neighborhoods” is also key to making sure that officers do not become desensitized or suffer from PTSD. I agree that enabling neighbors to protect their neighbors and themselves brings communities closer however it also puts people who have no training or experience in a precarious situations and can be a heavy burden on community members.  I believe there would be an uptick in firearm purchases as community members will feel as if the only way to protect themselves is to purchase a firearm and that is alarming. We can use technology to predict or evaluate police officers mental health, an example could be making police officer video log everyday before and after their shift.  Using the video log we can develop algorithms to determine the baseline mental health based on facial expressions and  word use for each officer.  By forcing the video log everyday the algorithms can predict if the police office is out of norm and if so flag that officer for an evaluation.  I believe in a hybrid solution of community members and the police department working together and diversity is the key."

Many people use the example of suburbs when it comes to imagining a society without police. Suburbs obviously have police but their role is often very different than what police often deal with in Minneapolis. Suburbs have very little poverty which allows the communities to function differently than in a large metropolitan city. We live in a capitalist economy which means there will be poor people and, unfortunately, poverty directly and indirectly contributes to many of the issues that areas of Minneapolis face where the police are often called to intervene.  There has not been enough information provided by the City Council for me to make an informed decision on whether or not to support this charter amendment. In order to support it, I will want to see a laid out proposal/plan for what this ""Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department"" would look like.

Attachment: Every civilization is governed by laws, without law society crumbles. Where there are laws, there must be law enforcement or lawlessness runs rampant and tramples the rights of law abiding, tax paying citizens.       We are in agreement that there is no place for racism in armed positions of authority, but to think we live in some kind of utopian society of law abiding citizens that have no need for law enforcement officers is beyond ridiculous.         Maybe it feels good to please the angry mob of protesters demanding their own idea of a quick fix to a problem that affects us all. Be ready to accept responsibility for the bloodshed in the streets as a result of   ending the police department as criminals take advantage at every turn.            There is an ongoing gang war between the North and South Minneapolis street gangs, shots are being fired day and night. Why aren’t people protesting the street gang violence that kills innocent bystanders of all races, including blacks?  This whole movement to replace the police department with this committee run community based department is predicated on racism. Why isn't anyone addressing black on black violence? Black Lives Matters while they live too. Why isn’t there a movement to guide youth away from gang violence before it’s too late? For that matter why aren’t people protesting crime and the criminals that are destroying property, stealing and murdering people without giving it a second thought because they were “dissed” on social media?      Before you ask the citizens of Minneapolis to vote yes or no to end the police department, you’ve got to lay out the vision and publicize it so they can make an intelligent decision. Right now, the ordinance puts it to a yes or no vote to remove the police department and replace it with this new department of public safety and crime prevention without any details of what that would entail and how it will affect the residents and tax payers of the city of Minneapolis.         How will average citizens specifically vetted to eliminate candidates with law enforcement training answer to the gun violence happening in the city day and night? Who will uphold the law and protect the innocent?  Who will determine which “branch” of public safety is needed for each situation? What will happen if it turns into something else or turns volatile? How will unarmed, average citizens protect the public from armed criminals who will kill people and destroy property without remorse? Crime prevention is great if it works, but all too often crime happens too quickly and after the violence happens it’s too late for prevention.         What makes you think a committee for public safety will not be prejudice or racist in their actions or that citizens responding to situations will not take vengeance and determine for themselves what is just in each situation? What would prevent these citizens from taking the law into their own hands? These people would need to wear body cameras to be held accountable for their actions just like police. How many people will comprise this new department that would be supervised by the city council? Will they be available around the clock for emergencies? Will they be held accountable? How long will they be in this position? Can they be fired?          I’ve studied the draft of the ordinance and the city council has all the power over this new department. The structure of this new department makes it subject completely to the micromanagement of thirteen individuals plus the Mayor. Direction by committee by its very nature would introduce bureaucratic red tape and bottlenecking of decision making. The police chief only has a three year term. City council members have unlimited four year terms. Which means if chaos and crime takes over, we as residents are stuck with a mess of a city and who will foot the bill? This new department will need funding and the ordinance does not clarify the source of the funding. This sounds like too much power for a small number of people to govern the safety of a city the size and crime rate of Minneapolis. One of the main goals that has been talked about is moving funds used for police to community resources. Yet the city council has recently spent thousands of tax payer dollars on private security to protect themselves. The rest of the residents of Minneapolis will have to fend for themselves with a heavily bureaucratic department ill equipped to fight crime in place of a police department.      We are in the middle of a deadly pandemic, with cases rising and people dying. Businesses are struggling, some are going under and many workers are unemployed. The economy has been hit hard it affects us all. Families are separated from their loved ones who are quarantined for their own safety. Now you add to all this surmounting anxiety, fear of the crime wave that will surely result in ending the police department.        Now is not the time to reinvent the wheel, scrap out police protection altogether and develop an untested, undeveloped alternative. The mobs demanding defunding and dismantling the police think they have a solution to the problem. The reality is that no one knows exactly how that would work or if it would solve the problem or create more problems and cost more lives. Replacing the police department with a small group of government employees ruling over a new department using Minneapolis residents as guinea pigs, does NOT solve the problem of racism. Racism lives inside people and is revealed by their actions regardless of position in society, whether within a police department of a department of public safety and crime prevention. Each individual is responsible for their own actions and needs to be accountable to the city of Minneapolis residents and governing bodies. In a city without a police department the streets would be ruled by gangs, crime would become more organized and businesses would be at the mercy of criminals. This is what happens when we don’t learn from the past."

"6/30/2020 7:28:08 PM",7,"","","I support the proposed charter amendment and attach here a statement of support. Attachment: Statement to the City Council of Minneapolis Written in Minneapolis, Minnesota on June 30, 2020  I write this comment with full-throated support for the amendment to § 7.3 to remove the Police Department and to create the Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department.  It has become abundantly clear that Black residents of Minneapolis feel less safe in our city, and I myself have hesitated and decided against calling the police when there have been escalated situations in my own neighborhood of Cedar Riverside. The New York Times reported June 3, 2020 that while 20% of Minneapolis is Black, nearly 60 percent of the time the person subject to police force is Black. (See https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of  -force.html). The article goes on to note that “police in Minneapolis used force against black people at a rate at least seven times that of white people during the past five years.” We cannot continue with business-as-usual in Minneapolis knowing this.  To be honest, I started into this conversation after George Floyd’s murder believing that we needed incremental changes to our policing. In my research, I have been shocked by the statistics above. And I have been disgusted by Office Bob Kroll’s record and behavior, and by the police union that he heads—but it makes these statistics above ones we should expect if we embrace city officers with demonstrated patterns of misconduct and thinly veiled white supremacist viewpoints. But still, I thought maybe more training in bias recognition and mental health support were what was needed, or perhaps restructuring so that every single officer became a community outreach officer. In short, I did not support a full restructuring away from having police.  But I changed my mind.  After a month of researching, I believe that what our city (and the cities across America) need is to replace the police with something that actually serves the communities’ much more nuanced needs—and with something that does not imperil our community members. This excerpt from an article (https://www.essence.com/feature/defund-police-abolition-m4bl-song/?fbclid=IwAR011AgOOBKrIRdkvL0aTHm1q1-CtbjplRtBVWNUGkGTXVAIAJNZbvGnKnI) sums up what I now think: ""When we say #DefundthePolice, what we’re really saying is #FundThePeople to be able to put resources toward real public safety. This intentional shift in how we spend public dollars will represent the beginnings of a just redistribution of wealth. We know, and the research confirms, what creates community safety is stable and affordable housing, well-funded public schools, accessible and quality health care for all, including community-based, non-coercive mental health services, and ending the criminalization of unmet mental health needs and drug use. And we’ve seen the success of community-based and culturally relevant violence prevention programs."" This is the direction Minneapolis should be taking. Amending the Charter is a step in that direction.  I know a lot of people will be afraid that we will be less safe without officers who can—if called for—use force in service of public safety. The problem is that the amount of times that’s what we actually need seems like it is a lot less often than justifies how much of a problem to public safety our police officers have been based on the above statistics. I read an insightful, albeit colorful, article from a former police officer who said that most of the time, police are there to take down your name and birthday after someone absconds with your minor possession. (See https://medium.com/@OfcrACab/confessions-of  -a-former-bastard-cop-bb14d17bc759). If we make this change to defund the police, here’s what this former officer observed, which I think is right: “Would there still be a few bad actors in the world? Sure, probably. What’s my solution for them, you’re no doubt asking. I’ll tell you what: generational poverty, food insecurity, houselessness, and for-profit medical care are all problems that can be solved in our lifetimes by rejecting the dehumanizing meat grinder of capitalism and white supremacy. Once that’s done, we can work on the edge cases together, with clearer hearts not clouded by a corrupt system."" I have to say, it seems about time to address those bigger systemic problems that lead to poverty and inequality, that in turn position people in society with choices that make them feel outside of any social contract that keeps them safe, well, and valued. We need to stop putting effort into police and start focusing on society—and on making a social contract that includes everyone in its benefits and rights.  In short, “[w]e cannot insist on “real change” in the United States by continuing to use the same methods, arguments, and failed political strategies that have brought us to this moment.” (See https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-do-we-change-america?fbclid=IwAR0s8wrtgy5pe78D5ndQ_QrwCPb-IW4cwqlUsupmB9bz81AnW9h1NU-QoNA). As with the whole U.S., so with Minneapolis. And if we are George Floyd’s Minneapolis, and we as a city do not rise to the task at hand of recognizing incremental change has failed, and if we do not become a city that rises to a new experiment in public safety, then I believe we have failed ourselves, our city, our children, and our Black community for this generation. Change this Charter, and we start down a new path that may be full of learning from our mistakes, but they will be new mistakes and not the same old mistakes that are killing our Black residents like George Floyd, like Jamar Clark, like Thurman Blevins, like Philando Castile, and like so many more before them.  Reflecting on this past month, I have observed that the protests in this city (and so many others) are because people have hope. They hope that if there is no justice, and they respond with no peace, that there are real leaders in our city who will act. This is the moment to prove their hope right.  I have read the new Charter language, and I fully agree we need a holistic, public health-oriented approach that does not equip officers with weapons and send them to respond to all emergencies. I also support the idea that the department’s head will have non-law enforcement experience in community safety services. I believe it is essential to not only restructure and rename this department, but to give it leadership with a different background who can create that more holistic vision engendered by this amendment.  Incremental changes to a police force, I have come to believe, is simply not good enough anymore. We have tried it, and it has failed, and we must try something else. We must, as Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “slam[] the door shut on a past of deadening passivity.” He went on to say, “The black revolution is much more than a struggle for the rights of [Black people]. It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flaws—racism, poverty, militarism, and materialism. It is exposing the evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society. It reveals systemic rather than superficial flaws and suggests that radical reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced.”   Thank you for moving forward with the changes to the Charter. They are overdue and welcome.  Sincerely,"

"6/30/2020 7:32:29 PM",-12,"","","Members of the Charter Commission:  I am writing you in favor of the charter amendment brought forth by Minneapolis City Council members to develop a new department of community safety and violence prevention. This department could then develop services based around a holistic, public-health oriented approach.  Minneapolis needs a transformative model of public safety. For years and years, community organizations and community members have been appearing before the city council to ask for divesting of funds from the ever-increasing MPD budget to fund public safety measures with a focus on community-led initiatives. These have ranged from housing to education to nutrition and youth engagement. As a citywide community here in Minneapolis, we recognize that to make sure we can thrive our neighborhoods must have adequate resources, strong schools, access to healthcare, and various other public service concerns that enrich and stabilize our lives. As an educator here in Minnesota, I have watched what defunding and lack of investment have meant for our public schools in the district. This is one example, and the negative effects ripple outward from the students to homes and neighborhoods.  Our city is built upon community after community that knows what it means to prioritize for our well-being. Throughout the uprising here in Minneapolis after George Floyd's murder by MPD officers, communities established donation and mutual aid centers, ensured medical treatments and prescriptions were procured for those in need, childcare was coordinated, and even healing/therapy professionals visited various areas in need. This happened in the moment. People came together to provide out of their own pockets, expertise, and energy. As was stated in a recent article from Teen Vogue featuring words from Kandace Montgomery, Director of Black Visions Collective, ""Communities with less police often have lower crime rates, but those communities also have well-resourced schools, accessible grocery stores, better-paying jobs, and cleaner air. The issue is not whether we need police to be safe; it's about figuring out how to get those basic resources and needs met."" I grew up, primarily, in two communities: a medium-sized suburb (Sterling, VA) and a small farm town (Kasson, MN). In both cases, our community had an extremely low police presence. I can't remember ever even seeing an officer while in Sterling. In Kasson, perhaps once a week, if that. But we did have: strong, well-funded schools, plenty of food options, access to clinics and healthcare, good-paying jobs, investments at the state/county level, and our community was able to thrive because we had what we needed. The police: they caught the occasional speeding motorist, the extremely rare break-in to investigate, or, in a real case of dire need, a domestic assault. But in Minneapolis, the MPD has a decades-long record of racial profiling, brutality, negligence, and violence that has had a disproportionate impact on Black, brown, and Indigenous communities.   Some are arguing for reform initiatives. But as MPD150's report lays out, the MPD has been a hallmark case in police reform initiatives that have not stemmed police brutality and have not addressed the underlying needs of communities in regards to public health. From Vox, ""In Minneapolis, before George Floyd was killed, police there had already undergone extensive anti-bias training, received body cameras, and engaged in other reformist options for reducing police violence. These methods did not sustain George Floyd's life."" MPD cannot be reformed nor its police union. We need something new. Something centered on communities, their needs, and a department under new oversight and guidance. We need it now. We cannot allow this abuse to continue. Friends, neighbors, and families are in the balance."
"6/30/2020 7:33:08 PM",3,"","","I support the proposed amendment and the difficult work ahead to improve the resources available to our whole community. Ward 12"
"6/30/2020 7:34:10 PM",-1,"","","I fully support this. The police cause more harm than prevent it"
"6/30/2020 7:34:19 PM",6,"","","My hubby and I would be very cautious about coming downtown for any reason without a strong police presence. We would look to other venues for gathering with friends. Police need support from other agencies, and i would defend a police department that generally works for the public good."
"6/30/2020 7:34:21 PM",-55,"","","While it is not an easy decision, I fully support removing the Minneapolis Police Department in favor of a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department. I know it sounds like a drastic solution, but it is the ONLY solution to the drastic, widespread, and endemic problem we are facing in our city.  Back in 2016, I was horrified at the murder of Philando Castile by St. Anthony police officers. My initial reaction was, ""This does NOT happen in Minnesota."" Maybe in other states, but not OUR state. Throughout the past four years, history has proven unequivocally that it DOES happen here.  The murder of George Floyd, and the MPD's reaction to it, has forever poisoned our citizenship against our own police force. Let us not forget the MPD's attempt to cover up the incident by initially declaring that ""a man died after a medical incident during police interaction"" in their preliminary investigation, while we were all watching body-cam footage of a racist cop brutally choking the life out of Floyd while he cried out for his mother. The reprehensible statements of Police Union leader Bob Kroll, criticizing the firing of the officers while our entire city was reeling from their actions, only underscores how little the entire MPD's leadership can be trusted, or will be trusted by Minnesotans.  I live in NE Minneapolis. It is an older neighborhood, and more conservative than many areas where protests have occurred. Still, I am amazed by how many BLM and Defund the Police signs I see in our neighborhood. People do not trust our police, and frankly, they shouldn't. The MPD has lost that trust through their own actions. Police forces often like citing the ""few bad apples"" adage as an excuse when their officers murder unarmed people of color. They rarely cite or acknowledge the end of that saying: That a few bad apples SPOIL THE ENTIRE BUNCH. The MPD has been spoiled. They've been spoiled by the actions of these cops, and the cops who have committed similar atrocities before them. It should be lost on NO ONE that the officers who were most at fault in this incident were VETERAN cops who have been on the force a long, long time.  The MPD has been spoiled by the initial reaction to this atrocity, their attempt to downplay the incident and gaslight our community into not believing what we were seeing with our own eyes. The MPD has been spoiled by abandoning our city for three days while rioting occurred, by slashing the tires of protesters, and by pelting citizens with paintballs and tear gas.  The MPD has been spoiled by the rash of officers quitting the force in protest of police reform. The MPD has been spoiled in part by the corrupt and violent actions of other police officers across the country, who have sowed distrust across our entire nation. I would feel sorry for them, if they didn't already have so much blood on their hands. And so defunding the MPD isn't that drastic of a solution after all. Instead it offers us a rare opportunity to start fresh, with a force that actually fulfills the intended goal of serving and protecting our community. A community-focused force without the decades of baggage that the MPD has earned with racist cops like Derek Chauvin and their vitriolic apologists like Bob Kroll. A force that the community can actually trust and work with --    because a Police force does not work PERIOD without the support of its community. The MPD forgot that a LONG time ago. A Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department can be built from the ground up to treat our community with compassion and understanding, to support and foster equality, and to finally end police brutality and racial discrimination, with the support of the community behind them. Does ANYONE believe the MPD can do the same? My wife doesn't trust the MPD. My 60+ year-old PARENTS do not trust the MPD. I do not trust the MPD, and based on the signs plastered all over my neighborhood, our citizens do not trust the MPD. It's time for a change."
"6/30/2020 7:34:43 PM",11,"","","I have lived in Minneapolis since 2007. In that time, I have not seen the Minneapolis Police Department fulfill a useful role in community safety.

"6/30/2020 7:36:03 PM",-3,"","","The idea to disband the Mpls police dept is the most outrageous thing I've heard in my 60 years on earth.  I'm strongly against this.  Although I don't live in the City, I'm in a first rung suburb that would be greatly effected."
"6/30/2020 7:36:31 PM",-32,"","","Last year I moved from the suburbs to downtown to be able to walk to work and enjoy the entertainment district (sports, concerts, theater, museums, restaurants, etc.). Within a few weeks of moving, I wondered if I had made a mistake. The summer of 2019 saw an uptick in crime all over Minneapolis, particularly in the downtown zone within a few blocks of my residence.  Shootings, homicides and gangs of youths attacking and beating people were captured on widely distributed video that made national news. I felt relieved when Chief Arradondo asked for additional officers and dejected when the City Council gave him a fraction.  In more recent weeks, my walks home have become so dangerous that my co-workers give me rides. Fireworks, drag racing, and donuts on Hennepin Ave at all hours of the night and lack of sleep are the norm. Shootings, homicides, armed robberies, and carjacking’s have skyrocketed. The Park Board of the #1 park system in the nation has given the stamp of approval for tent cities, including one just a few blocks from me.   The president of the City Council said on national television that calling 911 and expecting help might mean I come from a place of privilege. I thought my right to public safety came from the $4600 a year I pay in property taxes.  Apparently that right to safety is only afforded to City Council members that are in the process of defunding the police while at the same time so in fear of their own safety they have hired private security on the taxpayer’s dime. I can think of many families in North Minneapolis that wish they also could take advantage of private security.  MPD was already overworked and underfunded yet our ""progressive"" City Council has very publicly proclaimed they wish to defund and dismantle the police department. They made this announcement based on input from a select few groups with a clear agenda against law enforcement, yet they claim this is what the entire community wants to see happen. They have reimagined a utopian society were community members respond to crime leaving only a skeleton police force for the most violent crimes. This announcement was made without a concrete plan and is being rushed on the November ballot. It is absolute mayhem here with the City Council publicly denouncing the police while handing the keys to the city to the criminals. I implore you to spend any night listening to the police scanner to understand the state of our city. The media reports only about 1/10th of what is happening.  The recent riots after the death of George Floyd underscore the importance of having a chain of command, not 13 additional cooks in the kitchen trying to manage the next crisis the city may face.  I acknowledge the voices that ask for change within MPD, but to have fewer officers on the street will only cause the crime crisis to escalate. Businesses, restaurants, and citizens will leave Minneapolis only further eroding our sales and property tax base. Minneapolis will no longer be a metropolitan city known for large-scale events such as Super Bowl, Final Four, X Games, and various conventions. Minneapolis will be known as social experiment gone bad. Please do the right thing and reject this proposed amendment to the City Charter."
"6/30/2020 7:37:32 PM",6,"","","The City Council has no ability to run the city I once resided in.  Look at the backgrounds of the 14 members, no business experience what so ever.  You cannot dismantle the MPD in good conscience, it would be catastrophic to this once great city.  I sincerely hope this comment is not the only one here.  People of Minneapolis, wake up and get rid of these Marxists or Minneapolis will be the next Detroit. I don't reside in Minneapolis"
"6/30/2020 7:37:45 PM",-1,"","","I don’t think the solution is to replace the MPD. Why not talk about how the MPD should be reformed instead? 1) Drive cultural change in which color of the skin should not determine actions 2) Redefine the role of police in the community 3) Hold police accountable through data analysis as well as actions 3) Reduce militarizing the police 4) Screen and select the right candidates to join the police based on the new culture and role 5) Use some police funding for other community services like drugs, mental illness, education and poverty 6) Remove police who don’t want to be part of the new culture 7) revisit the rules of engagement with members of the community and 8) use force only for violent offenders."

I have ceased coming into Minneapolis and have not shopped at any store located in Minneapolis since the unrest and announcement of the defunding of the police. The crime has increased with the announcement of defunding and I will not enter Minneapolis as it feels very unsafe. I have not visited parks or bike trails.  I have not walked the lakes or trails.  If this goes through that you disband or limit the law enforcement of the Minneapolis police and do not increase their funding to keep the peace it will completely solidify my resolve to never enter the city or downtown to go to a restaurant, theatre, game event, or activity ever again.   As a controller at a service business I will not allow our employees to enter or service any business unless we have security which will increase the cost to any business that resides in the city of Minneapolis."
"6/30/2020 7:39:40 PM",9,"","","Minneapolis Charter Commission Members: I am writing to ask you to consider carefully changes to the Minneapolis City Charter, and to plan a thoughtful, inclusive, and transparent process that produces important and lasting change in the organization and governance of the Minneapolis Police Department, and better aligns city services with prevention and appropriate intervention in ways that keep all citizens safe and thriving.  Specifically, I am asking that you not approve a revision too the City Charter that would appear on the November ballot to eliminate MPD and create something akin to a department of safety. Let me be clear: Real, substantial, and rapid transformation of policing and community safety/development in Minneapolis is desperately needed. We have seen in clear focus with Mr. Floyd’s killing something that has been apparent for too long: MPD has too few resources or structural features or mechanisms to engage in “public service” in ways that we find humane and adaptive. They have weak processes or too little inclination to identify bad actors in their ranks and move them out. And we have tolerated problematic arrangements - including the “protections” afforded by the Police Officers Federation - for too long.  The culture of ‘warrior policing’ must end - but we must have a plan for what will take its place.  We should not fall prey to impulsive actions simply because we have ignored major and systemic problems for so long. Addressing complex problems requires thorough and careful analysis, thoughtful and iterative planning, and systematic implementation, evaluation, and iteration. To the best of my knowledge, the proposal before your commission reflects none of these features.  I am not asking you to do nothing - I am asking you to do “right.” We need deep and structural transformation of both policing in Minneapolis and attention to resources that reduce violence and antisocial behavior and promote adaptive and resilient behavior. Right now, we are in the midst of a burst of crime and violence not seen here in more than 20 years, and “stopping” without a plan and momentum for “starting” makes no sense. Chief Arradondo has demonstrated his commitment to beginning the ’starting’ and transformational work, and his efforts will be important as the Charter Commission, the Mayor, the City Council, and we citizens develop more complete plans for the longer-term future.  Please do not move the proposed amendment to the ballot at this time. Instead, express your commitment to real and meaningful change, and to a process that is likely to produce it. We can and must make the right choices here, for now and for the future."
"6/30/2020 7:39:43 PM",-25,"","","The actions of the MPD have for decades been shameful, lawless and indefensible. An officer should be held accountable just as any citizen of Minneapolis would be. It is far beyond time to dismantle the MPD and start new. The citizens of Minneapolis deserve to have officers who not only enforce the law but also abide by the same laws they enforce. Police brutality does not exist only in Minneapolis but nationwide. Policy changes has proven time and again to be worthless. No more excuses. It’s time they ALL face real consequences for those who acted in brutal, racist treatment of Minneapolis residents and those who refused to stop other officers abusing their power. They are ALL guilty. If I had 3 complaints at my job I’d be fired. How can we accept a system that allows an officer to keep their job after multiple “violent” complaints on their record?!!!!"

I can tell you that if you dismantle/disband the MPD that will be the last time I come into the city unless I absolutely have to, (i.e. going to the goverment center or something).   I am not the only person who lives in the suburbs who thinks this.  You can pander to the crowds right now by talking about disbanding the MPD, but know that the moment you do a lot of your business are going to suffer.

The City Council is reactionary groups of sycophants  who think more about their reputations than  seeking an all inclusive and effective approach to running the government.  All this money has been spent in down town and south Minneapolis and it looks like shit and it isn't safe. You need to be talking to the people who also want to keep the police with changes and ask them what and how needs to change to make a difference,  Not just yell, ""Dismantle/defund the police."" What a limited and self serving decision.  Frankly, we pay for the police and I don't want a second job in my neighborhood as a peace officer.  I was the neighborhood watch organizer and the police officer and I touched base occasionally to check in on the neighborhood issues and freebies for the neighborhood.  (Signs, material etc.) My suggestions are: increase the size of the police force, implement evidence based training and practices (look at Camden, New Jersey), Make living in Minneapolis a requirement.  For those currently not living in Minneapolis, require that they do 20 hours of volunteer community work a month.Consider paying more to the officers who live in Minneapolis.  Base it on a merit system instead of seniority in the police union.  Use re-education and supervision for infractions.  I also strongly urge that you license your officers and require that they do 20 hours of continuing education training in mental health, poverty and racism every year.    Peace officers are a secondary force and mental health professionals, social workers and psychiatrists would be very helpful but there would need to be a system for triaging or matching up a police officer and a health/mental health care professional. And for God's sake, please, please, please return the traffic cops to the streets.  I see so many acts of aggression when there is a serious traffic jam, or a light doesn't work and causes a jam, or even in the winter when the weather makes downtown driving a nightmare. We don't need another attempt to beautify or cram everyone apartment buildings.  Take what needs to be fixed now and plan ahead for these ""beautifying projects"".  It is an insult to the communities of color when the middle class white neighborhoods get all these designer changes and absolutely nothing is being done at large for communities of color.  This negligent at the least and racist on the other end.  Build a bike trail for Lisa Bender or an expensive entertainment center in an area that has poverty all around it.  Gentrification will only add taxes and an increase in property value will be forces on people who barely have the means to provide for themselves.  Put your priorities on building a community is safe for everyone and build in opportunities on the north side,  I'm not trying to segregate at all.  I' would suggest asking people how they would improve their area and fund it.  Is it any wonder that there is crime on the north side and mothers and fathers have to give their children ""the talk"" and then tell them to run for safety from their own neighborhood criminals.   I'm strongly considering moving from Minneapolis.  The taxes I pay don't go towards the real needs of the city.  They go to the self serving city council and the rest of Minneapolis suffers.  I have lived in Minneapolis since 1985 and this is the worst city council and recreation board I have ever witnessed.  Build a strong, beautiful and safe city and forget the foofoo decorations you promote.  I hope you ask the people for their solutions and don't believe that you know the answers right now. .

How exactly does that program help prevent violence after it already occurred?? Yes the police could do a better job connecting with the community. Why not require the police to be from Minneapolis so they are taking care of their own neighborhood? Also, it would help if people stopped committing crimes.

I know from first hand experience that calling 911 when there is a medical emergency is not always a safe choice; I waited for 30 minutes for emergency assistance when a man had overdosed on the light rail platform and had to call 911 multiple times before anyone arrived. The officers who did finally show up did not administer narcan and did not treat this man with dignity or respect. When we call 911 we have to weigh the chance that someone would be murdered rather than assisted and no one should ever have to do that.  Please do not allow former or current officers to make up any part of the new community safety plan.

I have lived in Minneapolis my whole life and have never once had a positive encounter with police. I have seen the endless cycle of police violence in Minneapolis and how it disproportionately affects Black, Indigenous, Latino, and poor communities. I have always felt safer to turn to my community in times of need rather than the police and with proper investment into our communities we will have the tools to ensure everyone is looked after and remains safe."
"6/30/2020 8:01:10 PM",13,"","","I would like to see more specific duties of the new department, including how their protocol will differ from the police department.

I'm so happy that City Council is making these amendments. Keep up the great work!"
"6/30/2020 8:01:15 PM",4,"","","I fully support this amendment. I wish it had stronger language preventing current/former MPD from continuing or acquiring positions in the new department without undergoing an intensive screening process."

"6/30/2020 8:02:42 PM",6,"","","While I wholeheartedly support the need for massive police reform in Minneapolis, I ask that you take the promised year before rushing a charter amendment to the ballot in November. Alternative solutions need time to be researched, proposed, and submitted for public comment. Rushing a charter amendment without a well-thought out alternative, while I’m sure we’ll-intentioned, is needlessly reckless. We have the opportunity to be a model for the entire country if we do this thoughtfully, so let’s take the time and make sure it is done right. If not, the naysayers will be right there to say “I told you so.” Let’s not give them that opportunity! Ward 13"
"6/30/2020 8:04:42 PM",6,"","","I would like to see a community room on the main level of the police station where groups could go through a liason to schedule events with officers. Events should be open to children to adult groups.  Samples ideas: Monisory school groups that get little tours or a story book read to them about kids and police officers read by a police officer. Scouting groups learning the different training it takes for the different rolls inside a police department. Or the state of the art electronic involved in modern policing. Senior groups meeting their local police and learning how to protect themselves from phone/computer scams. Home safety and security tips classes where officers sit with seniors to help them understand what to they can do to be prepared incase of an emergency; ie. help fill out emergency health packets to attach to the side of their fridge it case of emergency. Quarterly meet and greet events with focus on getting different parts of our community together; business owners, landlords, church groups...with an plan to building the community. Intro to self defense classes. These are just a few ways that trust/mutual respect/ friendships could be built between a group of highly trained people in very difficult jobs and the community they serve. Thank you for considering my proposal."
"6/30/2020 8:05:35 PM",11,"","","Please do not proceed with this charter amendment. It is reactive, vague and will only serve to complicate the situation even more. It is an idea without a plan at a time when we are all struggling to make sense of what is going on in our city. Creating a stronger role for the mayor would be helpful, so that all city residents vote for and have access to our leadership and real progress can be made toward re-building our city and establishing a fairer, kinder and more cooperative relationship among all of the people who serve our citizens, including police. Police reform is necessary, but this will not serve that goal. Police need to come to the table with all terms on the table and negotiate in good faith. but we also need them to be part of any solution."

Will we reduce the amount of money that is spent on the police department/violence prevention department? Can we have a tiny amount of police officers trained in de-escalation as well as violence prevention peace officers and social worker/case managers/psychologist? Can we take this moment to look at the need for holistic structural change, to house those in MPLS who are unhoused, support those who are addicted, those who are unemployed or employed at unlivable wages? How will this department be different and not abuse their power? How will we hold leadership accountable? Can we create policies that require all leadership to live within the city limits?

"6/30/2020 8:09:06 PM",-5,"","","I think it was incredibly irresponsible to make these statements and now actually voting on  “defunding” and  “abolishing” the police.  Action needs to be taken in the wake of several case of police brutality. However abolishing the police is not of them as cases of violence and murder surge in the city not to mention the frustration of theft and vandalism  .   The scary thing I saw was not viciousness but apathy in the faces of the officers arresting George Floyd.  Better training in de- escalation , better emotional health in our officers , more quality applicants , more educated,  better trained  , and more diversity is needed. What happened to the de escalation training promised after  the last Philando Castile and Justine R?  How you find these new people ? I don’t know but you’re not winning any fans the way it’s going or making it a desirable occupation.  Required degrees in criminal psychology? Don’t  bring the equivalent of an heavily weaponized military to situations that don’t warrant it but rather inflame situations?  We need police! We need caring and intelligent police !

While you want to strip away any feeling of security that people either visiting or live in Minneapolis require to have a vibrant community you hire private security at tax payer expense, disgraceful!  I will no longer be comfortable coming into the city for events and spending money when you take a persons security in such light regard. I can only hope that the good law abiding people that pay taxes and deserve a reasonable expectation of personal security vote you out of office. Needless to say I DO NOT SUPPORT what you propose."
"6/30/2020 8:10:36 PM",-29,"","","I support abolishing the Police Department and replacing with Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department. Accountability must exist for all peace officers. Qualified immunity must be eliminated, along with any other practice that uses past precedents to avoid accountability for present actions. Unions should negotiate benefits, not protect officers who are racist, victimize and/or murder citizens, especially at an egregious rate toward non-white, non-straight persons. In the new structure, a citizen review board must have powers to override police officers, internal affairs and the police union. City and county attorneys must prosecute abuses of power and all crimes, regardless of who does it (police) or who is the victim (persons of color). Mental health, homeless, parking violations and other similar issues do not need officers with a license to kill. I'm glad to hear that the City Council is moving forward with a complete restructuring of public safety and law enforcement services. Most importantly, citizens have the right to peacefully protest abuses by government, businesses and law enforcement - there is no reason to send in militarized law enforcement officers and inflict violence on citizens just to ""make it go away"" for the rich white business owners. I look forward to a new era of law enforcement the serves all citizens equally and justly. The new structure is required to remove the power of racism and finally create accountability for all citizens and city employees."
"6/30/2020 8:10:43 PM",-3,"","","It doesn’t go far enough. Oversight of “peace officers” needs to be laid out and transparent to the public. If we don’t address the root of the problem we won’t be able to fix it."

Most of the time when the government takes action, unintended consequences farther the problem, rather than the problem being solved. The problem being violence accruing in Minneapolis, and the police furthering the violence.  Insanity is trying the same solution and expecting different results.  Farther more, I hope the Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department does not farther the problem it will be created to solve. I hope we're not just renaming a police department.  One of the keys to solving violence is solving the basic needs of the individual, so they're not incentivized to be violent.  This will need to be a focus if we want individuals to be peaceful.  How do we give every member of Minneapolis their basic needs?  1. Universal basic income 2. Deregulation of laws which make experimental housing illegal, experimental housing is affordable housing I am very optimistic with the proposed changes.

The mayor is not the right person to be determining the education and supervision of the police force.  Put in place rewards and bonuses for good behavior and pay cuts/ time off for bad behavior like any other business.

Working in the mental health field for more than 10 years, has exposed me to dangerous situations and I've DE-escalated people without ever taking a life. My issue with MPD and the police structure overall, is the lack of compassion when dealing with POC. I've had several experiences with MPD who are like rogue cops. They arrive to the scene with closed minds, ears and hearts. I've regret calling them, and have chosen not to in, other situations. Most of them don't live in the communities they police, so they're totally disconnected from the people whom they serve. This is dangerous. In the past 10 years, several unarmed men, in MN, have been killed by police. If they're PEACE officers, who are supposed to protect and serve....then it is time to go back to the drawing board,  and figure out how that looks in practice. We need a structure who sees us as humans FIRST. So that taking a life will be the last resort, instead of first. Disband!!!"

People of color are speaking out to say they have never felt safe with the Minneapolis Police Department, despite past reform efforts. I think we can agree that all people in our City need to feel safe and have access to resources and opportunities to live a good life. Those asking to dismantle the police are not advocating for chaos, but rather a system that would put resources in place to prevent problems (such as better education, employment, and health opportunities), as well as provide targeted solutions, such as social workers being deployed to help with conflicts. Minneapolis has the opportunity to take the lead on envisioning a new way to keep its citizens safe. I hope you will push outside your comfort zone and the status quo to give all people the opportunity to voice their opinions in the coming months, and work together to forge a new way forward."
"6/30/2020 8:15:32 PM",-41,"","","I ask that you seriously consider what evidence we have for realigning public safety with this new proposed ammendment. Making sweeping changings unsupported by data could have disasterous effects on poverty and class mobility in Minneapolis. Violent crime is one of the main causal links in creating and sustaining poverty. Poverty and hopelessness also create conditions that increase violent crime. Crime is an index of the amount opression there is in a population. If this ammendment increases violent crime the city council will be directly responsible for creating a more opressed city with much more inequality, suffering and death.  We need to prevent violence and increase hope. We need gaurdians who will both protect and prevent violence. We live in a country with more guns than people, that fact does not change regardless of how anyone feels. Do the work. Find the right evidence to craft public safety reforms that work based on evidence not emotion.  Other cities like Vallejo have failed miserably at this type of change. Officer shootings went up in their case. I ask the charter commission to consult with experts in the science of crime and violence prevention before you move forward with ammendments like this. The Minneapolis city council could easily destroy the lives of tens of thousands of people in our community by making mistakes. Be careful."

Additional change and funding with relation to other departments that will also get new funding (schools, housing etc) should be a part of that plan presented to the residents of the city before we vote on a charter change."
"6/30/2020 8:17:24 PM",-8,"","","I fully support the charter amendment to remove the police department. I urge the council to mandate that no current or former police officers should be involved in the new safety and violence prevention department, as we do not want a new version of the current system. We want a new system that funds programs that address the root causes of inequality and crime: education, housing, healthcare, etc. A radical reworking of our carceral system will take time, but the first step of listening to the community is vital, and I am a resident of Minneapolis saying that I do not want police officers holding any power in this city to continue to enact violence on our communities."

This ballot question has been proposed without adequately or formally soliciting public opinion on this important issues. Moreover, the implications of this change to the Charter have not been sufficiently elaborated; there does not appear to be a clear plan in place, nor does there appear to be consensus within the ranks of City Council on what the forthcoming amendment will look like. The community has not been provided with explicit details outlining how City Council will provide for public safety if the proposed charter amendment is adopted. The City Council is putting this question to ballot prematurely and with a conspicuous lack of transparency. Such a hurried attempt is not appropriate given the gravity of this important issue. Specific actions are necessary to affect real change in our community, the City Council has not enumerated the actions it intends to take. They appear to be asking voters for full license to overhaul Minneapolis public safety at their own discretion and without oversight. It is incumbent upon City Council to provide specific details on what the proposed changes will actually be and how they will effect Minneapolis residents, only then should a change to the charter be considered."
"6/30/2020 8:20:49 PM",-27,"","","""Urgency"" is often a TOOL OF WHITE SUPREMACY. The community in Minneapolis KNOWS that you, our CITY COUNCIL, wants to respond immediately to the urgent, LONG PAST DUE, problem of POLICE BRUTALITY and VIOLENCE. I wish your Council had already been working diligently on this for the entire time (decades at this point) that community activists have been unsuccessfully inviting you to leadership- but you haven't done so.  I want you all to take responsibility for the fact that the problems in the Minneapolis Police Department have been known, they have been documented, and community activists have been advocating for your leadership on this issue for YEARS ALREADY. This council chose not to prioritize reigning in an out-of  -control Minneapolis Police Department and let them act with impunity, perpetrating crimes against the humanity of Black citizens, Brown Citizens, Disabled citizens, Native citizens, Homeless citizens, and other marginalized people UNTIL NOW.  So I say to you- this URGENCY...... is your own making. It is city leadership's making. I understand that many of you are in your first years on City Council and I am sorry you inherited this mess but you're in it now and I beg you to be VERY VERY considerate in every step you take.   Where is the due dilligence around HOW THESE SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS WILL IMPACT OUR CITY? Specifically how will this impact our most vulnerable populations? Where are your literature reviews? Where are your case studies? Where have you explained how those case studies are relevant/not relevant to a city like Minneapolis? What was your public, open, transparent methods used to come up with this amendment? Where are your expert testimonies? EXACTLY WHICH COMMUNITY MEMBERS DID YOU CONSULT? Honestly, WHO did you consult?  These are important questions. You owe at least this much to the people who have been brutalized, murdered, and incarcerated unjustly by this biased, violent and out of control police department.  THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO MESS UP BECAUSE IT WAS HURRIED. Haste will allow the racist white-liberal ideologies and power structures that created this police department and allowed it to continued unchecked for decades to be able to worm their way in to leadership positions on this ""civilian board."" I am terrified that there will be EVEN MORE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY than there is now with Police- who are at least licensed, who are at least public employees.... what about when ""KAREN"" and a bunch of her friends ""BECKY"" and ""HEATHER"" are in charge? Full stop. NO. THIS. CANNOT. BE. THE. UNINTENDED. OUTCOME.  I am very concerned that the city council is rushing out here to get something/anything done NOW and have sloppily thrown together an amendment that you really don't know how it is going to impact the city. One very very likely outcome is PURE CHAOS. This city does NOT need chaos- that will just be another window for white supremacy to sneak in on a power grab.  Instead, I implore you to DEFUND the department. GIVE THAT MONEY BACK TO COMMUNITY GROUPS and INVEST IT IN BLACK AND BROWN LEAD ORGANIZATIONS.  Instead, I call for you to CLEAN THE DAMN HOUSE- FIRE ALL OF THESE OFFICERS, except Chief Medaria Arradondo who has shown leadership here and who has the confidence of many stakeholders and longtime community activists! SUPPORT THIS CHIEF IN FIRING ALL THESE OFFICERS AND HIRING/RE-HIRING those can actually be trusted to act humanely, are willing to work out in the open and be transparent.  Instead, I implore you to take seriously ALL of the evidence-based recommendations that I know CUAPB have put before your Council over the last 20 years.  Instead of acting hastily, I implore you to radically re-vision and re-build the Minneapolis Police Department without doing so in a manner that will leave a gaping power vacuum that white supremacists will HAPPILY FILL up with their cadre ""concerned citizens"".

I currently live in North Minneapolis and am more afraid of cops than anything else around here. I'm sure if I were a POC this would be even worse. I am really proud of my city and my state for making the moves to change this. I hope it sees us into a period where we begin to address the roots of the social issues police are usually called into deal with. We could re-invest the money into housing, youth programming, job advancements, parks, etc. I think we should also be preparing every community servant with a deep understanding of the many varied communities they serve.

If the defunding of the police were to get passed I would drop the events as well.  Nit a single dollar would get spent in the Mpls city limits ever again.  Watching what has happened to Mpls over the past few months is truly sad, and a defunding of the police would really be the last straw for me.  I hear that from many others as well.  Mpls residents always say that suburban residents should keep there nose out of what Mpls does.  But that is far from the truth, we all come into the city to work, shop, and play.

"6/30/2020 8:25:37 PM",-4,"","","There is a need to continue having a police department given the size of our city and the demographics. The violence we continue to see in our city should be enough evidence to show that law and order require enforcement. The police union does need drastic reform in which officers cannot maintain their positions while having multiple offenses or complaints filed against them. As a resident of Minneapolis, the idea of removing the police force and replacing them with a community-based approach, rather than supplementing the existing police officers with appropriate mental health, social work, and other systems' help does provoke me to look at moving out of the city into a different community."
"6/30/2020 8:25:51 PM",12,"","","I strongly support the general idea here - we need to be removing the police from the city’s function. I appreciate the point in which the director of community safety has to come from a non police background. There are a couple of things that make me somewhat wary. For one, the new law enforcement division seems like it could easily just recreate police, and all of the profiling and violence a policing structure creates.  For another thing (somewhat related), It would be perhaps more comforting to see it alongside additional divisions, such as a mental health response division, a division for gendered and sexual violence, and more spread out responsibilities. I hope to see these come into being soon. I also wish that the law enforcement division is not overfunded or overpowered, and forces a completely different culture than policing has had for its history.  We can’t just replace the police with “peace officers” that are police by another name. Even if it looks good from the outside, black Minnesotans could continue to suffer constant mistreatment this way. I would love to see specific plans in place to prevent another police and a contingency for if what forms is more of the same. What’s more, I’m curious about how the new proposal (and the city council) seeks to address the other parts of the justice system, whether it involves more rehabilitative measures rather than carceral and punitive ones in response to law breaking. The police are an awful part of this system and I’m glad to see them go, but it’s important to make sure we keep fighting for the rest to go better."
"6/30/2020 8:26:03 PM",2,"","","My initial concern is about the nature of the peace officers mentioned. I just hope this doesn’t end up being a blatant rebranding of the same racist and harmful institution. I know the charter isn’t going to be the best place to lay out the specifics, but when it comes to it, we need safeguards in place. Percentages of budgetary spending guaranteed on the reinvestment in community. We need the defunding of the police department to include reparations for the black and indigenous populations."

Although we are both law abiding citizens, he is always very stressed coming to the city because of the MPDs history of violence against POC. I have seen the man put his hands on the dash when I got pulled over for a broken headlight one night. The MPD inspires fear, not safety. Any organization that is causing that much distress needs to be reimagined.  I know that my story is not the most brutal or shocking, but it is probably something that happens most often. Please, please, disband the police!"

They overreact to stressful situations, racially profile, and brutalize residents of the city. They, along with their union, have wielded too much power for too long and there are plenty of opportunities to reduce their involvement in our daily lives. If someone doesn't need to be shot to death (perhaps for trying to pass a counterfeit bill), then there doesn't need to be an armed police officer there. If we are going to keep the police in any form, they should only be used as a last resort and never used for non-violent emergencies."

If reform were possible under the current charter, the last 3 mayoral administrations would have succeeded. If the selection of a change agent as police chief were sufficient progress would have been made under the last two chiefs. Instead we are in a worse situation.  Drastic change is needed. The new language allows for freedom to respond to broader and potentially changing public safety needs. The changes in this amendment could create the circumstances under which Chief Arrondondo can be successful. It allows for a traditional police force under another name or something radically different. Without this charter change, no meaningful reform will occur. Budgets are moral documents. By specifying a number of police the charter requires an expenditure regardless of the size of the city budget — regardless of property tax payments, local government aid. It’s essentially an entitlement, but one that residents are not benefiting from. The increase in violence and lack of police response, while the police are fully funded, does little to demonstrate their value to community. By removing the specific formula that ensures the size and composition of the police force we can design a holistic public safety system that includes but does not center law enforcement. Finally, by putting this change on the ballot, there will be robust community education campaigns for and against. This will engage residents in thinking critically about this issue, another precondition for change and certainly a requirement for implementing a new vision of public safety. And by voting we ensure that more people have skin in the game of making and realizing this change. Ward 1"

They have not put forth any sort of detailed plan in which describes at length the measures they are taking and what that entails. A plan of action needs to be well thought out and have community input. We live in a major metropolitan area, and you cannot just eliminate the police as we know it. Crime has already increased since all of this began. People are worried about their safety and I also worry about the future of our city. Who will want to come to Minneapolis to do business, for recreation( sports, shopping, dining, etc when everyone thinks it’s unsafe and lawless.   I feel they are putting the cart before the horse so to speak and this needs to be thought out on how it affects the entire community.  I also have little confidence in the council and mayor to take into account what their constituents want- even on something like 2040 they didn’t care that lots of people opposed it.  They haven’t felt the need to do anything about policing issues in the past, but now all of the sudden it’s their number one priority. I feel like the council thinks it’s good PR to make a drastic change to prove they are willing to do something about the issues, but this cannot be a haste decision.Please do not allow this charter amendment to be made unless they have a complete plan of action and it also needs to be voted on by the citizens of Minneapolis. Thank you"
"6/30/2020 8:40:40 PM",1,"","","There is a need to continue having a police department given the size of our city and the demographics. The amendment does not state how funding will be established or maintained and whether there will be a minimum requirement for size of the department based on population size.  The violence we continue to see in our city should be enough evidence to show that law and order require enforcement. The police union does need drastic reform in which officers cannot maintain their positions while having multiple offenses or complaints filed against them. As a resident of Minneapolis, the idea of removing the police force and replacing them with a community-based approach, rather than supplementing the existing police officers with appropriate mental health, social work, and other systems' help does provoke me to look at moving out of the city into a different community.  The amendment should maintain that any responsibilities the mayor holds currently with regard to the police department, the city council will now maintain responsibility. If the intent in the first section of the proposed charter is to state that the council will hold the same responsibilities as the mayor currently holds -- more details should be added. There is no consideration made for future riots (remember rioting occurs both as celebration and anger; don't hold your breath, but maybe the Vikings will win a Super Bowl). What additional level of experience will be required of a future head of this department beyond having a non-police background? The issue is not the police. The issue is with holding people accountable for their actions -- in this case, the in action of the police union to remove officers who should have been removed long ago. Ward 12"

I support increasing violence prevention funding, including social supports and investments in the community to reduce crime. The amendment should clearly explain the proposal, which I assume and hope will be thoroughly planned in order to minimize any growing pains over the transition period. It will likely take years to fully transition, and it will take meaningful investments in funding the unarmed staff (social workers, others) and likely funding grants to encourage students to go into that field/profession. We already have a shortage of social workers/mental health professionals- there needs to be a plan and quality training in order to get this right.

We want PROVEN organizers and community MEMBERS to have the final say on who is in this ENTIRE department, not just this amendment's reassurances about one ""non-law enforcement"" experienced director.

I’m not naive enough to think our police department is perfect or that racism doesn’t exist.  However, the vast majority of our police force consist of hard working, non racist individuals.   Instead of “throwing out the baby with the bath water”, there needs to be reform.  Let’s start with more training and require yearly continuing education and training.  Teach more diversity, implicit bias, regularly discuss proper use of force, hold mandatory meetings after excessive uses of force to teach what went wrong and how things should be handled.  Discuss filing complaints against fellow officers and allow a more anonymous process.  Put civilians on the Internal Investigation boards. Next break down the hierarchy that stops less senior police from correcting bad behavior.  Do this through education, training, mock simulations and rule changes.  Enforce violations of even minor offenses. Establish rules for prompt resolution of excessive force complaints.  Set deadlines for each step of the process ie interviewing the complaining party, officer interviews, witness interviews, recommendations, final action, etc Educate about cultural differences with instruction from different cultural leaders.  Assign officers in areas of higher cultural populations to help them learn and serve those communities.   Require officers to live in Minneapolis!!!!  If they live among those they serve they will better understand the needs of the city and their role in our city. Make sure the police use interpreters when needed.  Allow and encourage collaboration with other service fields such as domestic abuse advocates, mental health workers, interpreters, medical personnel etc. Regularly teach de-escalation techniques, less invasive ways to obtain compliance, techniques to calm agitated people after they have been handcuffed... Pair inexperienced officers with more experienced officers but only allow officers with few to no excessive complaints to train/mentor newer officers.

If you really want to help the community, then instead of taking money from the police from social services, fund both adequately.  How about taxing the stadiums?   2. I'm a social worker and  am all about adding alternatives to policing, imprisonment or just letting people off.  Restorative justice, for example is an excellent intervention for many and should be used whenever possible.  Mental illness needs to be addressed.  We need to rethink whether deinstitionalization of those severely mentally ill who aren't compliant with their meds (often goes with the territory) really does them or anyone else a favor.    We need to think about the fact that we don't have enough hospital beds for the mentally ill who need psych wards.   We need to send trained workers into situations where someone is mentally ill rather than just sending police, who don't have the knowledge or skills to deescalate this type of situation.    But don't forget that an unarmed social worker could be in danger if attacked by someone who is violently mentally ill or, for example, someone in a domestic violence situation.  Don't expect them to deal with these situations without police backup.  If you're having trouble with this concept, just imagine sending your young son or daughter who just became a social worker into a home where there's domestic violence occurring with no pprotection.     4. Consider the fact that both police and teachers are asked to deal with social problems that are way beyond their capacity.   Consider that they are not paid well and get blamed by both the right and the left for problems they  didn't cause and can't fix.  5. Is this society really prepared to start paying attention to supporting essential workers like social workers, others in the mental health field, educators or (dare I mention it) police? Is the City Council really prepared to do this or do they just want to punish the police without really coming up with a plan to serve the city effectively?   6. Address PTSD in both marginalized communities and in the police communities, members of whom react out of trauma triggers in these situations.    7..   Listen to  ordinary black people not just activists.     Read the two very powerful posts, by black citizens, attached below. Read some of the letters in the Strib like the one from the woman who has lived in the north side for 30 years and is appalled by the council's idea.  8.     Read  about the Police and Black Men Project https://innovation.umn.edu/policeandblackmenmn/ and talk to their leaders,  Guy Bowling, community leader in the Police and Black Men Project (Minneapolis); responsible fatherhood parent educator, trainer, consultant, public speaker and Manager of the FATHER Project. and Bill Doherty, facilitator of the Police and Black Men Project Minneapolis, professor of family social science and co-founder of the grass root anti polorization group, Braver Angels https://braverangels.org/.   Talk to Cmdr Charlie Adams, a black Minneapolis police officer for 35 years, Commander in the Police Recruitment and Backgrounds Division; member of the Police and Black Men Project who says that if you defund the police the programs that will suffer are all those devoted to building community relationships.    9. Bottom line:    We have enormous difficulty holding in our hearts and minds the concepts of both compassion AND accountability regarding the same person or group of people.  We tend to err in one direction or the other (only compassion or only accountability), depending on our ideology and our personal experience.

I’d like to start off by saying that I grew up not far from where the riots took place and am saddened by all that has taken place. I also work off of 28th & Hiawatha helping folks in the community find gainful employment. I think it would be a terrible mistake to get rid of police completely. No one including myself will ever feel safe in Minneapolis if there are no police. The people that we help will no longer come for our services if they don’t feel safe taking public transportation. As you know businesses will close and move out of Minneapolis if there is no law and order. Crime is already getting out of control even before the crazy idea of disbanding the police. I can tell you that most police officers do the right thing but feel betrayed by the mayor and city council. If you want the police to reach out and connect with communities, then you need to support them. It’s a 2 way street. Please please stop putting out all of this misinformation that all police are corrupt. I agree that there is some corruption but don’t try to say that everyone is. If you go with the decision to disband the police; no one will visit Minneapolis. If people lose their lives due to violent crimes, the accountability will fall back on you."

People openly smoking pot and dealing near Target Center and Target Field became commonplace and has emboldened folks to loiter and intimidate over the years.  The police should not be defunded or eliminated as it protects law abiding people and keeps them safe or safer.  The city council needs to look closely at police unions and be focused on its citizens as opposed to political agendas, bike names, lake names, etc.  Residents and visitors pay taxes and safety is at the top of the list of what we expect.  Minneapolis’ handling of the last few weeks from the actions of a handful of officers and it’s politicians has been deplorable. Politicians are putting their citizens at risk!"

As city council president Lisa Bender has articulated, efforts at incremental reform of the police department have failed. As a city we need to move quickly to transform our public safety system. I believe this charter amendment gives the city council the flexibility to engage in a public engagement process that will result in meaningful change. Without this change, the city council will not have the power to move forward on the changes that the public is urgently demanding.  Thank you"

The City Council is currently planning to trade George Floyd’s life for many more in an attempt to rebrand policing. The problem is the MPD seems riddled with officers who behave however they choose with little accountability and punishment. Some choose to let their racism show in their policing. The racist views and behavior need to be removed from the MPD. That should not cost the entire city it’s safety. A law-keeping body must be trained, fair, compassionate and armed. This city is armed. Every neighborhood from rough to posh is armed. A peacekeeping force has to be trained and ready to meet this match for the rest of us. That is by definition a police force. It can have different rules and oversight, but do not for one second believe that a police force is not needed. A Violence Prevention Department can be put in place now. It should be. But where it fails to prevent violence, somebody has to respond. They should respond fairly, justly, and evenly to protect all citizens of Minneapolis. But they must respond and be strong. The City Council has to be strong in explaining this to people on all sides of the debate. The most vulnerable to violence are the ones who lack the resources and flexibility to escape the city. Think of them. Think of me and my unarmed family with two young kids. Think of George Floyd and his killer. Then do the right thing and fix the MPD by all means necessary.  But by all means, do not trade George Floyd’s life for decades of more violence and decay."

Budgeting 101 - if you defund or reduce you are eliminating; no matter how eloquently anyone tries to otherwise spin the process.  I find it ironic in a city when the Chief of Police recently asked for over 100 additional officers to keep pace with population growth (and were only granted 2-3 as I recall) now is being strategically dismantled. I also find it extremely hypocritical that some council members now have, or are afforded the ability, to have security...WHILE TRYING TO REDUCE POLICE. Does anyone see the problem here? Is it ok for the masses to fend for themselves like on Friday May 29th when you heard glass being shattered and businesses looted one block from my home?  I have purchased a house outside of Minneapolis and while this motion was not my primary driver, it sure made the decision easier.  As a current resident in Uptown you have had growing issues, pre-George Floyd, with persistent increase in more violent crimes. Why do I want to live here? Why would I want to work here? Does this help with the city’s 2040 plan? I can imagine it does not.  As a Regional Property Manager for the Global leader in multifamily housing - Do you realize that your large multi family buildings in Downtown continue to trend downward in occupancy as residents vacate to leave the city?  This concern goes far beyond a bandwagon approach and power grab of the city council. This decision has far and long term reaching implications that, honestly, none of us are equipped to comprehend."

I have been assaulted more time than I can count and the police are my only protection. I have knives pulled on me, physical attacks and death treats on myself and my family. Who is going to protect me when working? I know I would refuse to take calls if I didn’t have an officer on unsafe scenes. What about threats at hospitals and large venues? The police who first respond to medicals get there before the fire department and initiate life saving measures which increases the chance of someone walking out of the hospital. You are only hurting your citizens and economy by getting rid of the police. I know I will never visit Minneapolis for any reason if you decide to abolish the police. The rich will be able to pay for private armed security leaving those who can’t afford it to fend for themselves. If you want change the city needs to be focusing funds into more programs throughout the police department. Cutting funds but demanding more training is absurd. City officials have no idea how a police department works and yet can easily talk about how to run it. Take a look at other departments nation wide that have similar crime rates and look at what they are doing right and wrong and bring that back to Minneapolis. If you’re looking to screw over your residents and visitors then abolish the police and let the city burn because that’s what people will do."

Respectfully, the police department is necessary to ensure the safety of citizens and the community and while reform and further oversight may be required, abolishing the police force is not the answer. If you choose to do so, many citizens and businesses will leave the city.  This not only will impact the city negatively from a tax base but will also endanger citizens, businesses and those that work in the city. Crime was an issue prior to this proposal and is well documented from many incidents on innocent victims downtown and across Minneapolis in prior years. I urge the city council to reconsider its proposal for the safety of the city, it’s citizens, businesses and workers at those businesses."

Minneapolis has become a crime ridden shooting gallery in recent years.  The fact that the delusional Governor Walz, Mayor Frey, the entire city council are unfit to serve in any capacity that requires a spine. Wes Koostra the director of Metro Transit published an article on the company newsletter “ Insights”  In this article he describes himself as a Narcissistic Racist and called every white employee at Metro Transit a Racist ?  The fact that several members of the city council have taken our tax dollars and spent it on private security for themselves is beyond hypocritical. I moved out of the city of Minneapolis three years ago but I’m forced to work in the city.  By letting the Marxist mob burn down most of south Minneapolis shows zero concern for the people of the city the business community and any future businesses that will not move here to have a city out of control and run by a group of unqualified liberals who will destroy what is left of this once safe and beautiful city.

This shouldn't even come down to a vote, but rather YOU people need to stand up and protect all of us! Your life is no more valuable than ours and you have most certainly already proven that false with your private security!!! This state will look like Detroit in no time if you continue your ways, how about you all realize you're not capable of running this beautiful state and let others take control!? You are all cowards, and if you don't resign you will most certainly be voted out, so leave the police in place, you resign on your own terms, and justice will prevail! Option 2 you don't resign, people sitting on the outside get tired of this BS and take matters into their own hands, and much blood gets shed because people are tired of living in fear!!!! You have done nothing but allow a cult (BLM) to destroy a city while you all sit in your homes with your private security!!!!

Yes, investigate root causes and work to address them. Yes, hold officers accountable. But YES, hold the rest of us accountable, too! In the last month, the process of Minneapolis becoming a dangerous destination that my family and I will avoid has accelerated ten fold or more. We’ve had thee kids graduate from the. U of MN,  but our two high school daughters will NOT be attending there if laws are not enforced in Minneapolis. We’ve enjoyed Twins and Vikings games as well as concerts downtown.

We need reform, not abolishment of a police force. We need to fund basic Social Services, we need to provide educational opportunities, Healthcare opportunities, employment training and opportunities, on top of reforming the police force. Abolishing the police force does not solve the problem. Voting the people in office who are ineffective out and putting in people  who we feel are effective solves the problem.

You should also publicize what has happened in communities that have already done this. I think if people see examples they will feel more comfortable with it.

Continue to train officers while letting the public know “law enforcement” is there to enforce the law.  So don’t break the law.    3) Use the $790,000+ marked for art in the water treatment facility for social support in situations that the police could use the help.   4) Quit ruining our city.   5) Lobby to end things that emphasize race (a.k.a. Get rid of that question on all surveys).  6) Bring the people who stole (looted) and destroyed property to justice.   Another note: Because some police officers didn’t do their job, your reaction is to defund all police.  That’s like someone caught spitting in someone’s food at a fast food restaurant and then you trying to close all restaurants of that chain. Or if a teacher does something awful to defund all schools.  More needs to be done with teaching kindness, respect, care for all people, hateful speech/actions being held on the same level as racism.  That should start with you.

I want the process to be as open and transparent as possible. I want the mayor and city council to work together-both are responsible for the current situation, and both should work in good faith to move Minneapolis forward. Leaving the ultimate vote to the residents is a good idea. I hope Minneapolis can seize this moment and invent a system of public safety that works did all residents. The current system essentially works for no one so it seems like we don’t have much to lose.

The deepest cultural essence of the police is toxic, which means it cannot be reformed. Our police officers think they are at war with us when we are literally paying them for our own protection. Police should not be allowed to dehumanize the public.  The way our police responded to the George Floyd protests was horrifyingly stupid.

I agree that there are a few areas that could be better served by mediation but generally speaking we need trained enforcers to deal with all the crime in the city.  The north side has been a terror zone.   My daughter works in that area as a nurse, taking care of the elderly and handicapped.  She’s terrified to go to work as she has to maneuver through the streets off West Broadway and has been telling me about all the gunfire going on EVERY SINGLE DAY.  If the city chooses to delete the police force, the criminal element will run amuck, and your bad decision will affect ME when you need help in nasty situations and you call police in from the surrounding areas to deal with your problems.  That costs ME money in taxes and a possible slower response from my now over burdened city.   I think you should keep what officers you can (as I know they’re quitting right and left) and spend money on body cameras for all police.  The police deal with the dregs of humanity every hour of every day and that has to wear a person down.  I wouldn’t want that job.   Also, I think it absolutely disgusting that you talk about getting rid of the police but your own council members have taxpayers paying for security.  Talk about having different laws and rules for the ‘elite’ politicians.   Lastly, if you go ahead and deprive us of police, when businesses won’t move into the destroyed areas of the city fearing high insurance prices and no police to take care of the roving criminals, the rest of the state should not pay ONE CENT in extra taxes trying to redevelop the lake street area which already is pretty slummish.  You’ve forced taxes on us for the Metro Rail that is used by very few and for stadiums that most of us don’t go to or utilize.  This decision affects ALL OF US - Minnesotans and indeed the rest of the country as liberal lackeys like yourselves attempt to follow suit and endanger the entire country.  If you as our state government worry about people owning guns, then you need to know that we will protect ourselves from criminals.   A lot of innocent people will get hurt."

"6/29/2020 11:33:38 PM",-22,"","","If the City Council can guarantee Minneapolis residents that there will be no crime in the city, then defunding the police might seem worth considering. Recent gun violence seems to the contrary. On the Thursday night following George Floyd's killing I was on 27th just south of Lake St. trying to save an ethnic restaurant from the vandals/arsonists and looters. When the police abandoned the area around 10:30 pm I saw first hand what can happen when mobs with their imbedded rioters fear no consequence for their destruction. No police presence led to pure mayhem. Consider that when you continue your grandstanding on abolishing the police department.  I also ask if someone on the City Council could explain to me the logic behind, after the Wednesday night looting of the Minnehaha Liquor Store with far worse to follow, that you expected the MPD--the cause for all the anger and outrage--to be the people who could control the city after May 26th? How about the Hennepin County sheriff officers? National Guard?  I cannot believe with how horrible the video of Chauvin casually snuffing out the life of George Floyd over 7:46 with three other officers observing, that the prospect of a Ferguson like uprising was not contemplated. If contemplated, what was the plan of action? Surely the MPD was obviously not the right choice. That error in judgment cost many small businesses along Lake Street their survival."

I am unable to open the amendment but I think that there are numerous situations that could be addressed by other groups/subgroups/departments with a more specialized lens and stop the one stop shop mentality with 911 and the police.  There are few situations that require an armed and trained in force officer. A $20 counterfeit certainly does NOT.   More specialization would naturally evolve more knowledge on the given area of specialty.   For example with theft from home or a car, you do NOT need an armed officer to file a report of stolen items, an admin assistant can do that and perhaps more investigation could occur (minimal occurs at present).  Homeless and those intoxicated would require a whole different ‘department’.   Different ‘departments’ could serve as a checks and balance System with one another.  Investigation needs to separate from first responders as we currently seem to have very little investigation occurring.  First responders/trained and armed individuals should be highly trained and paid accordingly, fewer but more qualified."

I can guarantee you there will be a mass exodus out of Minneapolis of residents who can, for the lack of police presence, and you’ll continue to see an increase in violence and crime as the city becomes overtaken by people who know they can get away with it.

Street violence has been a part of Penn Ave for too many years dating back to Jackie Cherry Holmes with city council calling me, personally asking why the dirt bag Jerome Scott ""JT"" was allowed to reside in my property. a good friend of mine worked in undercover narcotics and later as a homicide lieutenant confided that they don't care about me they don't care about themselves. Absolutely City council has no clue what goes on in the street and hides in their homes calling for private security, paid by the taxpayers. The whole system is a diabolical mess throughout the governing body of the state and City of Mpls. Sadly you look like a bunch of clowns and I can't remember a time that I've ever enjoyed the City of Mpls since playing hockey in 1976 when I was a high school player in hockey. Curtis hotel was a dump in Mpls continues to be a complete cesspool. I will also add the likes of inspections that is not consistent throughout the city when I do light ups and see the standards people are living in rentals.

I share you to have the facts from a long-time resident: My perspective is as a parent living in Central Neighborhood on 3rd Avenue South, a couple blocks south of Lake Street. We are graduated to just me, my wife and son who is the only white boy attending Cristo Rey High School just north of Lake Street in 4th Ave. We are also blessed with three adult daughters who grew up here after we moved back from Peru 8 years ago. My youngest daughter ran the Youth Farm project in South Minneapolis next to Baha’i and across from 38th and Chicago until she transferred it to Sister’s Camelot last year. She helped plant those fruit trees. We have lived here and paid taxes for eight years. I grew up the son of International school teachers in Asia and Africa. Qualifications: I do not come at these conversations lightly. Trained in Cristian Community Development, lived and worked on four continents, and experienced life here in the United States in Chicago, New York, and New Orleans before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina. I have run large-scale volunteer hurricane Relief efforts (10,000+). I am also trained by FEMA in the National Incident Management System and am certified in CISM (Critical Incident Stress Management). My wife and I, along with our kids, were in Peru working among victims of sexual abuse and family violence as well as human trafficking. I am also a fellow with the International Academy of Apologetics, Evangelism and Human Rights our of Strasbourg, France and certified in Christian Community Development philosophy as well as Christian Outreach. My master’s degree is in missiology, the study of cross-cultural communication of Good News, with an undergraduate philosophy degree focusing on political ethics and a double major in communication. While in South Minneapolis I have particularly focused on working within the Somali community and taught Somali Adult Literacy Training courses on a weekly basis for four years. Last year I worked as a consultant for an agency that houses previously incarcerated individuals. As of July 1, I will be coming on staff full-time at Bethany International/Global University in Bloomington. I have spent the last seven years teaching there a college course called “Seeking Justice in God’s Mission.” So, That all said, I to make sure that what I am involved with is using global best practices. I know a number of police officers, some quite good. We needed a number of those officers to protect our family and rescue one of our family from tragedy. I am privileged to not know the particularly bad police officers that the current system has not stopped from their evil, murderous, racism (systemically allowed through a powerful infrastructure). In Peru, and a few churches here in the US, I have given basic speeches on the importance of human rights from an American Christian perspective. My only published works are in missiology and Peruvian law journals but I have studied quite a bit and want to be involved if needed. I have spoken before in other settings, testifying on various issues like prison reform or housing for previously incarcerated individuals, at city, county, state, and national levels. With a researched global perspective of local interests, my family and I want MORE officers with better training, and a meritocracy not union protectionism."

This is only the first step to facing and changing the systematic racism within our politics. I want to see the city and state give its community members real power to make decisions for the way we keep our communities safe. Defund the police and use those funds to invest in our education systems, hire BIPOC teachers, truly affordable PUBLIC housing for the most vulnerable, free healthcare and Covid care, free housing for our homeless community!  All this depends on revising the charter, so put that on the ballot for November."

It ought to be possible, in 2020, to be treated equally under the law without resorting to protests and demonstrations. It ought to be possible for our elected officials to act to dismantle the source of oppression in our city without people resorting to vandalism and looting; and it should be possible to feel safe in the City of Minneapolis while being non-white."

While I don't live there any more....I will happily spend my money supporting communities that support the hard working men and women of law enforcement."
"6/30/2020 12:24:36 AM",15,"","","I want to preface my comments with the fact that I _was_ a resident of Minneapolis for quite a while and no longer am. I have lived there for a good chunk of my adult life, and could imagine living there again. I've spent a lot of time there advocating for Minneapolis 2040, which is a framework of policy ideas developed around a shared vision of ending disparities (that's rightly the #1 goal, because racial disparities are the #1 problem). I am aware that the 2040 plan passed unanimously and in the end was supported by the full city council, and the mayor.  I'm glad to see real policies are now coming out of this process that reflect the views and goals: among the things, Minneapolis has begun strengthening tenant protections, and begun undoing the long legacy of racist zoning policies. There is more to do, but it's good to see the city taking its first steps. Included in the Minneapolis 2040 plan is a policy section on Public Safety, which outlines the following goals:  a.) Follow a public health approach to ending violence by reducing the factors that put people at risk for being involved with violence. b.) Expand the use of non-enforcement, community-driven public safety strategies and responses such as restorative practices that can address and repair the harm caused by a crime.   c.) Proactively build trust between first responders and the community. d.) Ensure that first responders reflect the diversity of the city’s residents. e.) Maintain and enhance a public safety infrastructure that improves response times to police and fire calls, implements new technologies, provides operation and training opportunities, and improves communication among public safety agencies. f.) Maintain the City’s Emergency Operations Plan. It seems that Minneapolis would be able to address many of these goals with the establishment of a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department. I realize the conversation and work won't end there, but I want my hometown to be able to have that conversation, and uphold its duty to the city to make real progress. I am writing to wholeheartedly support the ballot question and charter amendment. I wish I could vote on it, and since I can't, I will do what I can to make sure my friends turn up and vote in my place. I am also writing to remind the City Council, and especially the Mayor, that they have all agreed on these goals at one point in time, and now is the time to follow through with meaningful and long-lasting action. The City of Minneapolis must remove the Minneapolis Police Department, and establish something better."

The bad is what needs addressing but you are trying to build a system from a ground up and the society will be the lab-mice. There has been so much violence and disorder and disrespect towards law -it's horrible. Obviously we do not excuse the actions of the bad police but neither do we burn places down and lash out and disobey the law and attack police when a murder is commited by a man without a police suit. A suit isn't the issue here. Men by nature will do evil and within this 'new system' you will likewise find evil men as well. Please don't destroy our city. Restore order. Restore peace. Justice and law. This isn't mercy and understanding when I have to hide in my house and fear to take my children outside. This is disorder and chaos. This needs to end. And by the way, how in the world does minneapolis vote to get rid of police without the people voting? This is absolutely shocking to me. The city sends us letters and puts 'questions' on our ballots every couple years to raise our taxes for schools and what not but somehow they completely decided to take over our safety without our input? Who are these people who decided to vote without hearing what I and my neighbours had to say first?  You are putting my children and our families in danger. This situation has gotten out of hand and someone has to restore things to how they used to be FIRST. We are not people pleases and we arent going to stand for demands of any organization at the expense if my children's lives. Move forward. Create better accountability in the police force like national database where people can review cops and leave opinions, make a mandatory lie detective tests for every officer, hire more black cops and provide insentives to train young black men to be cops but restore honor and order to police. Law enforcement is good. Justice is sweet. And you people have no idea how to discern a difference between a protest and crime. Stop normalizing everything and not addressing and naming things as they are. Crime is crime. Crime is real. Drug addiction is real. Murder is real. We need laws and consequences. People are dying on streets while you are instilling in all the criminals that 'our city is no longer needy of police'. Well, they will respond, all the more better for me do exactly what I like doing : rob, kill, rape, and alike."

The police have not been allowed to perform their duties to protect the community for many years. I left as I did not feel safe AT ALL, having been burgled several times, vehicle stolen and witnessing constant drug trafficking and reckless driving. The current it’s council is Ill prepared or knowledgeable and they are trying to push their individual agendas. For the mayor to “allow” the rioting to escalate as it did is shameful. For the police officers to kill Mr Floyd is unfathomable how it occurred. Retraining is necessary, but police are needed and to be able to do their jobs."

I understand the need for other solutions to many of our concerns in our city, but the solution is not eliminating the police department.  As it stands now our police department is understaffed to the point that our officers are often unable to respond to serious, in progress, crimes of violence.  I feel strongly this proposal is knee jerk and potentially dangerous to our city.  I also have a great deal of faith in Chief Arradondo’s leadership and believe he can to do amazing things in the Minneapolis Police Department if given the proper backing by the city council, mayor, residents and the rank and file of MPD."

We also have some of the highest population of people who are affected by police misconduct and abuse.  If the current city council was serious about community safety they have had YEARs to help reduce violence- we have been more violent every year.  If they were serious about police reform- they have the power to negotiate at contract renewal and could take on the police union.  This amendment doesn’t do that It seeks to consolidate the power in the city council. It’s calculated and cruel to do to all of us at a time when we need real leadership. The current council president Bender is holding snide and insulting polls about this and our intellect on Twitter (see attached photo). It’s demoralizing.  The council has not worked with North or my wards citizens to find out if we want this. They chose for us. That’s not representative legislation, it’s personal views- that doesn’t feel democratic to me.  I support Chief Arradondo in continuing to make the needed and past due reforms in our police department.

Reform the police. Make them a part of a newly imagined department, but tell me exactly what that is and how it will all operate before asking for my support.

By all means add a community of safety and violence prevention department (in the size and scope of the existing PD) to target pretty crimes (corrective action for these crimes outside of the court system) raise community awareness and forge links, as well as focus on mental health calls and support for those in crisis. This department should include ties to the school system. Let the PD get back to focusing on major crimes, dangerous deviant behavior and keeping communities safe. They are so understaffed is not even funny. Thousands of cases of property theft and vandalism go without investigation because the officers don't have time (along with a ton of other issues) . Crime flourishes in an environment where there is no punishment or just a slap on the wrist. Invest in positive change with more training and support. Identify bad apples and behaviors earlier and take corrective action to retrain or terminate. Add more mental health support for officers! The system is broken! There's understaffing, a lack of support and respect for officers as well as way too high of tensions in the community and PD. When everyone lives in fear, hate wins and negative actions and reactions just escalate. It's a powder keg that got lit up. The city council is NOT the appropriate decision maker in this matter to abolish what little PD we have. There are a lot of changes that need to be made, but abolishing what is in place is taking it way too far. What happened should have NEVER gone down like that and no BIPOC should ever live in fear of interaction with the PD or other authority figures. Make positive change happen! Let's build up a better support system!"

"6/30/2020 12:52:11 AM",13,"","","For nearly 2 decades I have working in the city of Minneapolis. Downtown was like a second home to me for 10 years. If I wasn't working, I was surely there to catch a game, a show, or just gather with friends at a local watering hole. Sure, there was crime. One might even argue that it was dangerous to be on the street after a certain time of night. But it felt safe to me. I then started working in uptown. It was quiet during the week and lively on the weekends. One thing it had that downtown didn't - it definitely felt like a neighborhood. It felt like home. After quite some time in uptown, I reluctantly made my way back to work in downtown Minneapolis, and to my surprise, I hardly recognized it. Apartment complexes had gone up on a number of corners. It was lively and bustling. People largely seemed to enjoy themselves. They looked at home, because they WERE home. Minneapolis had successfully made downtown feel like a warm, inviting neighborhood, much like uptown. Fast forward a few years, and the city is in chaos. The murder of George Floyd has resonated throughout the country, but nowhere is it felt more than here, in our home. Crime is through the roof. Downtown is a rowdy, lawless warzone, full of shootings, stabbings, robberies. Large groups congregate in the parking lots, shooting off fireworks and starting fights with people who walk by. The police, who have put their lives on the line day in and day out to protect us, are now with their backs against the wall, unable to act for fear of retaliation from the citizens they have sworn to protect. It is absolutely terrifying the direction that things are going right now. Do we need reform? Absolutely. Something needs to change, and it needs to change NOW. But removing, or even thinning out those who would gladly put their lives on the line for YOU and YOUR FAMILY is not the answer. I am already nervous to venture into Minneapolis due to the unrest and recent violence, but I can promise you that if the police department is abolished or defunded, I will not be setting foot in that city from here on out. Please, do the right thing. Make the best choice for the safety of your citizens, not just their votes come November. Thank you."

"6/30/2020 1:00:40 AM",-1,"","","I am not in favor of disbanding the police force.  While it is clear the Minneapolis police have had a history of excessive force,  I believe having a police department is essential to maintaining safety for all Minneapolis residents as well as people who enjoy coming the city for various activities.  I feel the move to disband the police is reckless as well as incredulous and puts many more people in harm, especially those in the neighborhoods in Minneapolis.  I feel most police officers are good cops.  I happen to know a now former Minneapolis police officer who is a neighbor.  He decided to quit after all the chaos that ensued this last month and was diagnosed with PTSD due to the rioting.  It is tragic that people are getting killed by police,  but equally tragic we do not support our police.  This isn't to say we don't hold them accountable,  but to look at single acts of individuals and make blanket assumptions about the whole department is nearsighted at best.  You are asking that these people act 100% without error and with perfect judgement under conditions and scenarios that the average person is not capable of comprehending.  We expect them to be infallible yet I don't think any of the city council could do their job half as well.  I would like to see the city council members actually ride along for a week and see what situations these people are put in day in and day out and see if they can so assuredly say that dismantling the police is the next logical step.  I implore you to reconsider this step and look for more constructive ways to deal with police brutality without being utterly moronic."
"6/30/2020 1:00:58 AM",-15,"","","First of all.  THE MAJORITY of police officers are NOT racist.   Just because a police officer stops an individual who happens to of color does not a racist make.   PLENTY of black on black stops are made daily.  You can't be a black person stopped by a black cop and call that racist.   Yes a FEW new procedures and re training events should happen.   We also should put funding towards SOCIAL WORKERS who have a police background to FIND OFFICERS who are wound too tight.  Like Ex Officer Chauvin.   NOW THEN. HOW ABOUT A FRESH IDEA! How about we start teaching inner city black youth to STOP RESISTING ARREST!  STOP RESISTING THE POLICE!!!!   If Floyd hadn't resisted arrest, FOR SOMETHING HE HIMSELF DID, he would have lived.   He would have lived and Half of Minneapolis would not have been burned down by Racist Liberal Whitr youth ginning up less educated black kids. DO NOT PRETEND FOR A MINUTE  this is not the TRUTH AND THE HEART THE HEART OF THE MATTER!! Instead of community organizers running around calling even the alley cats racist...  I know, QUITE POSSIBLY they could help by teaching inner city youth about God, Famiy, WORK ETHIC, how to finish school and get an education.   THERE IS WAY MORE funding out there for black kids these days than any other race.   That is, if, we are going to continue down the race road. These are sound measures if put into action. IF you rid Minneapolis of the police as we know it...   Who are you going to call when the next Sandy Hook event happens?   I'm ex military, conceal carry permit, and I know very well how, where and when to shoot.   But please, don't call me because I'm a so called racist white honkey devil, (inner city lingo).   SO DON'T call me.  If I'm driving by, I'll call a peace nik social worker and that's about it.   It doesn't matter that myself and PLENTY others like me could end any given mass shooting in mere seconds.   So chew on that.   Let that all sink in.  By the way?  I don't need to mention Church goers on any given Sunday Morning while the mob kids sleep it off.  Just sayn.

"6/30/2020 1:04:49 AM",-24,"","","I think that defunding the police department is an absolutely horrible idea. I live in a what was a peaceful neighborhood that is now in shambles. The past two days I have almost been run over walking per careless drivers of Somalian decent and this is clearly intentional. There have been shootings and things are only going to get worse with this when a pandemic is happening as we speak. The whole demeanor of uptown changes around 5 to 6 PM and you absolutely do not feel safe. I have been mugged 3 times in this city, everytime of which someone of black decent (2 times a group of men.) One time in was hurt so badly and someone on a bike called the police. The police officer showed up and drove me around the neighborhood of Loring Park to try and see if we could find who mugged me. After about 10 minutes I was saying I do not think we will find this person and he dropped me off at home, which was very kind. I was punched in the eye and got a hematoma and concussion as a result to the blow to my right eye. That police officer did everything in his power to help me and today I am forever grateful for that. I am a member of the GLBT community and as a minority as well I feel the need for protections only a police department can provide. Only expect crime to get even worse if we go to this left wing nonsense. What happened on May 25th is a tragedy, but I cannot support the violence, burning of our city, and crime that is ensuing in our city. Clearly our news is not really nothing who the perpetrators are because they want to be ""politically correct"" and not offend anybody. I have many black friends that also agree with me on this matter. I am not a racist person I just am fed up. Our economy is already in trouble and because of violence more businesses are closing, remaining closed and some never to reopen again. We need to do what is right and wr need to keep our law enforcement- because without them there is no law and the anarchy will continue. Now I ask you, how does a Community of Safety and Violence Department deescalate what is happening right now? It would have to be a very convincing plan in order for me to even give this a serious thought."

However, I urge the Minneapolis City Council not to rush into decision on this. We need to make well-researched, well-informed decisions about how to move forward. Do not lose momentum but also don't completely lose what little stability we have left.  Every, and I do mean every, resident of this city should feel safe to talk to the Police.

How can you expect people to follow laws when there is no police force, when they obviously have no intention to follow the laws of public safety when there is a police force STILL in position? I'm all for trying it. Send your social workers to my street at midnight to stop the fireworks so I can sleep. If you cant accomplish this, how do expect to accomplish anything else?

"6/30/2020 1:33:40 AM",26,"","","I think that removing from the Minneapolis charter, the provision that the city must provide a police force, is a purely symbolic gesture to appease a vocal slice of the Minneapolis population. I would prefer that the city council focus on pragmatic changes they can make to the police department that is supported by the vast majority of the citizens of Minneapolis. If the city council must change the city charter, if only for symbolism, I hope that a robust force of peace officers remains intact. Before the death of George Floyd, I was hoping that the city would increase the number of police officers, commensurate with the increase in our city’s population. I still think we should have more police officers, rather than less. A humble question I have is: do the Minneapolis police officers feel understaffed? And if they do, would helping to alleviate that feeling, lead to fewer mistakes being made by the police? Finally, I would like to offer a suggestion as to how we could bridge the divide of trust between the Minneapolis Police, and the community that it serves. I read an interesting opinion article in the Star Tribune that suggested Minneapolis police officers be mandated to perform a minimum number of volunteer hours per year of community service within the city of Minneapolis. The police officers should be paid their normal wages while performing their community service, and be allowed to perform their hours of community service on days, and during times, of their normal work shift. That way, the police would be less likely to feel resentment towards this policy. The officers would not be allowed to wear their uniform during their community service, in order to help put everyone at ease. And, the more time the officers spend their community service hours specifically working with, or around, young black men, the better.

The men and women who responded when my normally quiet North Minneapolis corner when it erupted with over 40 gunshots on a Tuesday evening around 6pm as my family sat down to dinner - those men and women are essential!  Who am I going to call next time this happens? Who is going to protect us? Are the street gangs, criminal element, drug dealers, domestic abusers, etc. going to have free reign without the police?  Since the riots a few weeks ago crime had spiked and gun related violence is topping the charts - is this because those who are responsible know the police are walking on eggshells and are under scrutiny? Who are we punishing the police or the residents and citizens of Minneapolis?  Reform, more training, education, community review boards, so on so forth YES !  But to completely remove the police department - NO!"
"6/30/2020 1:36:45 AM",-19,"","","A technical comment. Before your start writing an amendment please identify what outcomes you want to achieve, what metrics you will use to measure success, which resources you will need to bring to bear and what obstacles you need to overcome. Example - high levels of public satisfaction with city quality of life - better health and safety measures - lower crime rates - low percent of suspects arrested without resistance - fewer injuries and deaths to suspects, bystanders and police, Fewer charges per offender with early arrest Public safety department structure - all officers live in city or previously lived in city for st least 10 years, staff mirrors the community in.terms of age, gender, race, national origin and other factors - police teams are mixed in terms of age, race and gender. You will never get what you want if you don’t have a lengthy discussion about what you achieve.  Defund the police is a vague, confusing strategy.- you need more than a slofan. Many have failed to reform public safety - a hastily devised solution is at greater risk of being rejected, which along with an acquittal is likely to oromote more protests and community violence, exactly what this is trying to avoid."

But I cannot vote for the amendment unless there is a concrete plan for how the new department will be structured, and run  how laws will be enforced, who will respond to 911 calls, and how the transition will occur. With that information i can choose how to vote for what is best for our city."

From their roots as slave patrollers, the Klu Klux Klan, or paid mercenaries of private corporations, to their violent action against union movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, to the modern day, the American police have existed to be footsoldiers of repression, racism, and injustice. The fact that they do all of this evil with funds provided by the very people they repress, assault, and murder is an affront to justice and logic. They are an occupying army, trained to hate and fear anyone but themselves and their masters, and given free rein to vent their hatred on an undeserving public. We, as human beings, deserve better than to be murdered by violent gangsters just because they wear a badge. They cannot be trusted, and must be removed for a just society to exist."

"6/30/2020 1:43:01 AM",-5,"","","Do not allow the Minneapolis police department to be defunded, dismantled or diminished in any way. The city council has been defunding the police for some time, In 2006 there were 1000 police officers a month ago there were ~ 800. We have seen a corresponding increase in crime (enough so that it got the attention of the state legislature) and a demoralized, fatigued, overworked police force over that time. We need more police not fewer. Without police people will not come to the city.  A huge part of Minneapolis' revenue comes from people coming into the city for sporting events, concerts, festivals, dining, the lakes, museums, theaters. etc. and spend the money that Minneapolis depends on. If it is not safe people will not come here. I have lived here a long time and have never thought of leaving. If the police department is cut in any way and in fact, not restored to a more realistic number I, and many others will be leaving the city. The most basic function of city government is protection of it's citizens. That requires an adequately staffed, healthy, robust, well trained police department. I see this proposal as myopic at best and an attempted  back door money grab at the expense of the people of Minneapolis and a power grab by the city council as it disregards the citizens. This movement is not based in sound data or facts . . . .  DO NOT ALLOW THE CITY COUNCIL TO DEFUND, DISBAND OR DIMINISH THE POLICE FORCE IN ANY WAY."

What do the council members mean by ""holistic, public health orientated"".   That literally has no meaning. It is a phrase that can be defined by a million variables.  Are you planning on hiring social workers and mental health workers?  I am unclear what you would want them to do.   I would say leave social work and mental health to the Public Health Dept and policing to police.   Otherwise I would demand that the entire city council would stand and apologize to the city when a social worker or mental health worker gets injured or worse when ""a client"" gets mad and there is no backup.   And who is going to be the leader?   Is the city council going to lead?  Well that is just asking for chaos.  Let the Mayor and the police chief do their jobs.   But I noted there was no defined police chief role.  So what will that role be?   I again believe that it should be well defined before asking citizens to vote.   I also do not think it is fair to the citizens of this city to have to vote without knowing how many minimum police  there will be per capita.   I think we should know before voting.   I want to know that police doing their job have enough back up to do their job without putting their lives at risk.  I want to know police will not be mandated to work overtime because they city council fails them.    And I personally do not think the city council should be involved in making those decisions.    Bottom line, right now it appears the city council wants to take over the Mayor's role in regards to leadership.   I believe that is wrong and will only weaken our city, especially when the leader of the city council believes that policing is a privilege, not a right.   If that is the case, then the city should just hire private police and those that can afford to have police come, get help.  That is arrogant and wrong.  If the city council would like to help further define what makes good vs bad policing, then they should do that in specific language.  But to just put out a vague and undefined statement is asking me to vote with my eyes closed, my ears shut and ignorant.    I need to know specifics.   The guiding statement  ""holistic, public health oriented"" does not tell me anything.  Oh by the way, I am liscensed by the State of MN as a public health RN."

As a business owner in Minneapolis, I will move out of the city if this goes into effect and the police department is removed, dismantled or defunded. Period. And I won’t be the only one who goes.  Dismantling the police department doesn’t solve anything. Go after the Union instead, which has systematically enabled repeat-offender problem cops to thrive unchecked for years. If you don’t perform in the business world, you are held accountable and, yes, fired. If you fail to perform as an officer and have multiple write-ups and corrective actions stacked against you, then what happens? Not much if Derek Chauvin is a testament. He should have been terminated years ago but the Union prevented that from happening, protecting him and other bad actors while allowing them to continue the abuse and malpractice. *That* is the system you should work to change."

"6/30/2020 2:06:41 AM",22,"","","My hope is that you take a more scientific approach to understanding the root cause of our MPD issues. The data is clear - there are systemic operational issues that directly and inequitably impact black people and many other minorities as well. And there are personnel issues who exploit those systemic issues to carry out police actions that also oppress and unfairly target black people and many other minorities. However, sound, ethical leadership would clearly choose to rewrite, reprogram, rebuild police policy and procedure to correct the systemic issues. And That same  leadership would remove the personnel that do not fit with the revised hiring profile replacing them with new peace officers from the communities in which they live and serve. Our police chief is the person for this very job. The police union leadership (Kroll) is not.  We need our police. We need our public safety. We need to continue the process of rebuilding our police force around a new model of ethical peace keeping. Do not throw the baby out with the bath water. You will be committing a horrific injustice to our black, white, Latino, Hmong, and many other communities that need and WANT a reliable law enforcement presence.  Defunding is a short sided, I’ll conceived, ignorant answer to our racism issues. There are 100 situations that the empirical evidence shows to support our dire need for strong law and peace protection.  Should you choose defunding, you will cost many many more lives and you will lose your tax base as your wealthier city residents will flee for the suburbs.  Do your jobs. Listen to the residents all around the city. Listen to 911 calls for a full week. Go out with officers for a full week. Witness the black on black, white on black, white on white, black on white Latino on Asian etc. crimes in our city. Recognize the good work done by our police department. Then help to change what’s broken from within. You have a willing tax base, a super competent and progressive police chief and a mayor that will help you do the right thing.  So do the right thing and help fix the issues instead of creating a lawless city."
"6/30/2020 2:11:19 AM",0,"","","As a post-doctoral student at Louisiana State University, I teach and conduct research focused on organizational change and college success. I have experienced numerous educational institutions in my 13 years of paraprofessional and professional leadership, serving more than 100,000 students in five states and two countries. During this time I worked with campus and local police, fire departments, health centers, and local mental health services. From these collaborations, I have learned that the single most important strategy in assuring student circumvention of the criminal justice system is the privilege educational environments provide for those who simply hiccup over policy confusion, as well as those who are committed to causing controversy within their communities. I am sending a piece of my resolution for post police Services, which I originally drafted for an academic journal and then begin to share with stakeholders nationwide.  My idea for a post-police structure is community-based, leaning on the education and expertise of trained counselors, organizational consultants, human resources professionals, social workers, lawyers, teachers, and community organizers to develop the Lyft or Uber of community safety. Policing is outdated and ineffective. It has shown to preserve peace only for those who are deemed more valuable in society than others, based on the ownership of property. Property - no matter how expensive, no matter how elaborate - is less important than human life; the criminal justice system as it stands today does not believe this. This ideology is reinforced by qualified immunity and the burden placed on taxpayers for financial settlements. We live in a state that preserves plantations better than it does neighborhoods of people whose ancestors were tortured on now manicured, commercialized properties. This state enjoys drawing in profits with tours of ornate mansions, which ignore the stories of those who suffered for generations upon it. We should not commend ourselves for having hundreds of these properties protected and only one being forward enough to mention the victims of a system we have not yet eradicated from our society. Policing is an extension of the generational terrorism of enslavement and the state should not pocket funds off of that land. State entities, like our educational institutions and businesses, should not provide programming and events on this land, as many of these institutions themselves lay upon stolen lands, encrusted with the blood of those they still fail to educate and serve.   A    resolution would be to create a phone application, where citizens can report suspected criminal activity, non-criminal disturbances, as well as a need for emergency assistance. This application would be able to provide particular expertise in the type of service needed by the reporter. For example, if a family member is having a mental health emergency, instead of calling 911, we can now report the health emergency to a system where someone who has years of experience with Mental Health crisis can intercede, and where family members can upload live data of the person's actions. This way we have an all in one way of showing proof that an occurrence happened, which is available to an expert consultant, who can provide live suggestions for de-escalation, as well as someone to come on the scene if necessary to rectify the situation face to face, in a manner appropriate to the level of need. Our citizens should not have to play expert by using Google to find out a resolution to an issue in a moment of fear. If the resolution involves the possibility of someone’s safety being threatened, we should be providing services for our citizens to get help for free without feeling threatened or them second-guessing their reflex to get help. In addition, an application would allow us to gain analytics on the reporter and their level and quality of social engagement during demanding community episodes."

"6/30/2020 2:26:48 AM",-19,"","","I think the efficacy of this entire amendment hinges on how many ""peace officers"" will actually be a part of this ""Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department"".   The physical safety of our entire community depends on how many brave men and women are willing to take up arms and put their lives on the line for someone who is almost always a stranger to them.  The vast majority of us are not willing to live such lives. I've seen many comments about this amendment which say such men and women will likely be moderately, or severely reduced in numbers... should the amendment pass.  This would have a disproportionately dangerous impact on impoverished communities, wherein gang rule is always lurking just outside the walls of police order.  If word got out among such communities that there are less armed officers patrolling, and less armed officers ready and willing to respond to calls... well, it would be quite fortunate news for the most criminal and degenerate among said communities.  I think if the riots showed us anything -- what with situations like 911 being unresponsive, only to return the call *3 hours later* -- it's that when a big surge of crime came in the form of violent riots, the city of Minneapolis was already underprepared with the number of armed officers available for dispatch.  If there had been more officers available, perhaps fewer minority-owned small businesses would have ben burned to the ground.  Perhaps fewer jobs would have been lost among already underemployed communities.  Perhaps less public transportation would have been rendered out-of  -service, and more carless people would have at least been able to get out of town to where there were grocery stores and pharmacies that had not yet been destroyed. So to sit here and hear people talking about how we need LESS armed officers, after witnessing the aforementioned suffering that was a direct result of having too few officers available to keep the peace during the riots.... it boggles the mind as to how anybody could think that LESS is the solution.  After the heinous death of George Floyd, I think we all want *better* police.  But you don't make the police better just by reducing their numbers.  We want better police.  Not less police.   Thank you for your time. P.S. It is also worth noting the importance of these officers *being armed*.  Be it full-fledged pyromaniacal rioting, or a domestic abuse call... how exactly is any officer supposed to establish order and deescalate the scene without the suspects at hand knowing that he or she is armed?  How is the officer supposed to know whether or not there is a firearm at the house, business, or even car that they are approaching?  It's not pretty, but like it or not the firearm is a crucial element of what actually gets belligerent and violent men to stop, listen, and hopefully to cease & desist.  Just asking nicely, while unarmed, won't go very far with a wife-beater... and it sure won't go very far with an angry mob.  The officer(s) need to be able to walk in and immediately establish an alpha role, this is just how men operate.  If they don't, or can't, then the violent and belligerent men in question will not respect them and continue to be violent and belligerent - thus escalating the scene. Thank you for your time."

Already with inner city business’ closing and major Fortune 500 companies contemplate reducing their real estate to move jobs to home, Minneapolis will start to see a shift in money due to these unprecedented times. As many Facebook residents of the Twin Cities noted specifically of the  second precient and elsewhere see increase rates of crime, residents are starting to move out of the city and will continue to do so at a higher rate with no physical police presence as expressed on social media and internal personal work discussions. We will continue to see less jobs in the inner metropolitan area because of COVID, and what entrepreneurs like us watch rates of crime increase reducing likelihood of business potential. This reduction in jobs and inflow of money will likely add stress to Increases crime activity.

I believe their actions and planned actions are and will cause grave consequences to the businesses and safety of the residents of this city. I believe that the Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and violence prevention should be something that is discussed with the community and voted on by the community before the City Council removes the Police Department as a Charter Department, Article VII and Article VIII.  If you are planning to have year-long community engagement and input in this process, then why do we need to make this change now?  The City Council does not need more power over this process, especially since they do not include the community they serve in the process.    Mr Cunningham has repeatedly ignored constituents input or requested feedback through polling that doesn’t allow for alternative opinions, to justify his policy decisions. I am a victim of domestic violence. With no police presence I fear my abuser will return to shoot me, as he has pointed a gun at me in the past. You may review my open restraining order and all my 911 calls for proof.  The recent acts of Council Members have made me lose trust in these city leaders.

My coworkers are not renewing their leases in Uptown or Downtown this summer, worrying there will be another wave of riots.  I'm just as afraid of what this will do to Minneapolis' image just as much as I'm worried about my wife walking to the gym downtown by herself.

Nor will I recommend event locations for company parties, such as the previously done Budweiser deck at Target Field.  The proposed is a reaction taken out of pain. Not one of thought out, data driven stats.  In addition, I know multiple MPD officers who do wonderful things for the citizens of Minneapolis daily.  They’ve done more for their community members than any recent protest has. I hope the multiple good MPD encounters still stand for something when making this decision. Personally I know many parents already looking to move out of Minneapolis and remove their children from the schools within.

In the olden days, my cousin and I would go school clothes shopping and have lunch and it was a really big treat.  I beg you to consider what this move would do to commerce and events.  Minneapolis ""used"" to be cool but now seems to moving in the direction of Detroit."

"6/30/2020 5:04:06 AM",-15,"","","I have worked in downtown Minneapolis for almost 15 years. The only time I feel comfortable walking from my bus or car to the office is when I see police officers on the street and in the skyway around me. I have been harassed and threatened multiple times and coworkers have been assaulted, mugged and raped and because of this we are all encouraged to never walk alone to and from work. If police officers (who can strictly enforce the law) are no longer policing the areas where people just hang out, deal drugs, harass people walking by, etc. I will no longer feel safe coming to work and will plead to work from home permanently or find another employer outside of the downtown area.  Reform is needed, more training is needed, adding more social workers, therapists, alternatives to police are a good thing so it can be decided who fits each call coming in and adding peace officers to patrol along side the police officers is great. But placing people in the streets to be the friends of everyone isn’t going to make the actual criminals stop anything, I would expect to see a much higher rate of violence when they have nothing to fear and have no consequences for their actions. My opinion is that highly trained officers should be added, who are specially trained to deal with the workings of inner city issues and crimes (but still actual police officers) be added, in order to make the city safe, reduce the amount of people hanging around the streets (not coming or going from anywhere) looking for opportunities to commit crimes."

"6/30/2020 5:23:11 AM",6,"","","I am 100% in disagreement with making any change this fast. To put this on the ballot of which will hopefully be the largest voter turnout ever is completely irresponsible. There is no way you will educate the public in this short of time. We do not want uneducated voters making this type of decision. I am also 100% in support of our current Chief. As a resident I am instead asking you to do what is necessary to give him the power to make the decisions he believes is necessary to take control of the police department. The 12 respected officers who spoke up in support of the Chief should be listened to. The power of the union is what needs to be resolved. Give the Chief the ability to do so."
"6/30/2020 5:23:17 AM",-9,"","","I live on the border of Minneapolis and St. Paul. I work as a paramedic in the metro and work with police officers everyday. I agree with changing the roles of police officers and they should not be handling calls of mental health, minor domestic issues, and some non-emergent/emergent medical 911 calls. Dismantling the police sounds like getting rid of them entirely, which is dangerous, since we have already seen an increase in shootings since the death of Floyd. I am 100% on board with social workers or mental health experts to respond to those 911 calls of mental health. The problem now is that police officers are the only ones who can write a transport hold on non cooperative suicidal/homicidal patients to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. For this reason, PD are required to come to mental health calls. I think PD should have less on their plate for responsibilities so they can focus on crime issues that they are actually trained for in their academies. They do not get extensive training on medical calls or issues, and most of the time do not need to be there. As an extra precaution, when police are going to make an arrest, they should call for paramedics when they call for back up and their supervisor. This would ensure that suspects receive medical attention right away and even stop police from causing harm like in the instance of George Floyd. PD is necessary for safety, but take all the extra non crime related issues off their plates. Make them experts in their fields of crime with the focus on how to do those calls well."

Anyone from the old organization who wants a job in the new one should have to apply and pass it’s actually rigorous requirements.  Important: if we are truly asking these folks to project and serve, then *public* safety (including criminals, as best possible) is ‘job #1’ , *not* their own. “I was afraid for my life” should be a defense or reasoning they give up a right to use when they take the job that’s given the city sanctioned monopoly on use of violence.

They continue to traumatize all peoples of color and indigenous peoples as we live our lives and fail to protect us when we really do need protection, as demonstrated by their response to George Floyd and to the white supremacists thereafter. But also whenever we have needed assistance with health, mental health, or domestic issues. We want no reference to the police or their continued existence in the Charter.

I cannot stress how vehemently I oppose your plans. They are not good for the residents of Minneapolis. They are not good for the businesses of Minneapolis. They will destroy the very neighborhoods you intend to help, especially those facing challenges already. They will deter trade and events coming to Minneapolis. And innocent people will die. That's the reality. I've read your ideas and policy surrounding the issue and frankly, it naive and based on an urban utopia that does not currently exist. The reality is that crime is rising, gun crime is rising, and lawlessness is taking over. We need a LARGER police presence to deter, not a smaller police presence which will only embolden those intent on destruction.  Your ideas may feel good. But they don't do good. And that, equals bad policy.  Please do not proceed. The future of the city hangs in the balance. And not all can afford the private security you have employed to keep you safe.

"6/30/2020 6:41:03 AM",-7,"","","My family is absolutely against this crazy proposal to defund and or abolish MPD. We hope this City Council is defunded!! They truly do not support anyone, only their current agenda to remove MPD. The Councilors do not reply to our emails or calls regarding this issue. Of course we can’t show our disapproval because of covid19 restrictions at meetings.  I’ve lived here 40 years and always had positive feelings towards the MPD.  I work and live in Mpls and this idea of disbanding police is the last straw for us. We will take our money elsewhere, a community that’s supports the Police and safety of its citizens.  During the riots, our Elected Officials failed the law abiding and scared residents of Mpls.  They were elected to do a job and they have failed us, and only support their crazy, far left agendas."
"6/30/2020 6:41:34 AM",-26,"","","As a criminal defense attorney, I can say without hesitation or hyperbole that a vast overwhelming majority of the time a crime is committed ... armed, licensed peace officers with arrest authority are neither necessary nor appropriate responders to the situation at hand. We need bottom-up critical re-evaluation of how and when armed agents of the city/state should be called upon (if at all) to address complaints of wrongdoing. We should be restricting their use and authority to act only to situations where the threat of violence is immediate (e.g. 'there's an intruder in my house', or an active shooter at large). Otherwise they should be available to render assistance at a scene as a last resort when deescalation strategies have failed. We need to stop taking people into custody at the outset for all offenses where no violence or injury has occurred. The decades-long expansion of 'policing' generally has failed as an experiment. It's time for a new approach. Our problems cannot be reformed. We need to start over."

I am also someone who understands our desperate need for the third executive branch of our government, law enforcement. The violence in North Minneapolis has exploded ever since the cops became overwhelmed with protests. I used to frequent Minneapolis and do my shopping there. I no longer feel safe. Teenagers with guns are stealing cars at gunpoints. Daily shoot outs are happening in the streets. We need police presence, or gangs will fully rule. It’s just the way things are. If you remove law enforcement, you remove the law, and I am not interested in living in a city governed only by gangs."

Get rid of the bad apples, thoroughly screen and go through every officer and axe all of the ones connected to hate groups or who post hateful messages.  Require more training for peace officers to help solve problems and recognize delicate situations. Immediately punish current police officers who commit murder of unarmed people.  Legalize marijuana/cannabis use Abolish mandatory minimum sentences Reform/rehabilitate inmates through education Stop locking up mentally ill people End cash bail Just to name a few things that could reform all of the justice system not just the police"

We need to fix people, not get rid of a job that does so much good. I am from a small town and feel safe knowing my local enforcement is here if I need them or don’t. My husband and I often dine in Minneapolis and are able to do so because we feel safe knowing if something happens, enforcement is there. I believe that without that presence, crime will rise and people may choose to act on criminal behavior that they otherwise might not. We’ve chosen to look elsewhere for dining options (hopefully temporarily) and miss the places we would go. I’d love for the Minneapolis police to remain funded and have the support of their city."

As a resident, we had a great relationship with the police. In fact we celebrated that every year on national night out in August.  Currently we attend events and establishments in Minneapolis frequently, whether that is restaurants, bars or concerts. I worried with all the crime downtown this past winter but did not stop, however if you get rid of the police department it would end any time we spend in Minneapolis.

"6/30/2020 6:50:30 AM",-8,"","","I am a graduate student at the University of Minnesota. Although I reside in Burnsville, I spend the majority of my waking hours in Minneapolis. I have always felt safe on campus. However, since murder of George Floyd there has been a significant decrease in police presence and a sharp increase in violent crimes committed on campus. The unrest in Minneapolis has been trickling on to the UMN campus and without a police presence it will only get worse. Abolishing a police department would be so insanely detrimental to our city and the surrounding areas. There has been over 100 shootings in Minneapolis since Memorial Day. How can a “holistic, mental health-oriented” approach alleviate a violent crime when it is occurring? Show me a list of mental health experts who would willingly run towards gunshots to save members of our community. I don’t understand how the city council think they could send non-police officers into violent situations to handle issues like active shooters or domestic assault. I wholeheartedly agree with Mayor Frey. It is clear that our Minneapolis PD needs to be held to a higher standard and they are in need of more training. In order to achieve these goals we must not defund or dismantle the police department. The PD needs adequate funding for retraining. I also believe we should have more funding for community outreach programs, as we need to start mending the divide between law enforcement and members of our community."

Crime is going to rise and tourism is going to drop, significantly. If you want to create change you should facilitate conversation with the Minneapolis police department. There is focus on the military and PTSD for military troops. Why isn’t there the same focus for police officers?? I should also note that city council having private security is hypocritical. If you move forward to disband the police, they should have to forgo their protection."
"6/30/2020 6:52:23 AM",-6,"","","Replace MPD with a department of individuals with extensive training in crisis management, de-escalation tactics, and with a lot of empathy training to serve the public. Fund programs to help people at risk for turning to criminal activity."

"6/30/2020 6:53:30 AM",2,"","","As a Minneapolis citizen and social worker, I strongly support the proposal to remove the police department and establish a Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department. As a mental health social worker I frequently work closely with police officers, and I see firsthand that they are not equipped to deal with what is often being asked of them. Divesting from the enormous budget that the MPD has and allocating that to services that support the community is a must. Black, brown, and low income communities need services and supports in place NOT more patrolling. The police are killing our citizens and we cannot continue to allow that to happen."
"6/30/2020 6:53:40 AM",8,"","","I beg you not to take away the police. You should actually be adding and training them better.

Being able to go to the Farmers Market, walk for coffee while my daughter practices at Vertical Endeavors and visit museums are all things I thoroughly enjoy. We occasionally splurge on high end restaurants.  If you take away the police I will not visit Minneapolis. I don’t want to see social workers negotiating with mentally ill, deranged people. I am not okay with violent crime.    There are a lot of other really nice city’s with great events and restaurants that still value their police force - that’s where I’ll be spending my time."

These changes are knee jerk reactions from people who have absolutely zero experience in law enforcement. Instead of the knee here reactions with no experience or legitimate first hand knowledge, every council member should spend multiple shifts working along side the law enforcement officers of Minneapolis PD. If at that time, this same change seems necessary, so be it. However, if this change is implemented my and my families business will go else where (sad, we love downtown) and I will be forced to protect my employees well being and safety and not have them visit Minneapolis and enter Minneapolis while on company time."

If anything I am in favor of increasing the Police Department, as the Chief of Police has requested, and increasing the salaries and requirements to be a member of the force.

If we want a vibrant attractive city we must have a safe city."

Those people are not getting arrested but just a slap on the wrist. I have seen many videos of black people beating up random white people downtown. If that was me, calling whatever the supposed new name would never be able to help me. Talking to a criminal will not get them to stop beating me up.

"6/30/2020 7:08:40 AM",0,"","","Minneapolis Council Members: Good morning. I am a longtime resident of Minneapolis, and I am also a Minneapolis Police Officer, and a person of color.  I have been an officer for 27 years now, with almost all of that time as a street officer.  I am currently in charge of our Community Service Officers, and I have worked as a Cadre Officer for our police academy for 10 years prior to that. During my time as an officer I have seen the ugly side of policing, but I have also witnessed the good in both the department and the community.  I have always tried to treat everyone with respect and dignity, even under the harshest of conditions. Everyone, despite racial or economic lines deserves that. What former officer Chauvin did was horrific, and watching that footage shook me to my core.  We do not, and have never taught our officers, cadets, or recruits to place a knee on anyone’s neck.  Make no mistake, Chauvin deserves to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and Thao does too.  Both of those officers not only failed the City of Minneapolis, they failed this police department, and most important, they failed George Floyd.  That man should be alive and with his family now.  I cannot express enough my condolences to his family, and deep horror and sadness they must feel. Does this department need change?  Absolutely.  Does this department need some of its funding diverted to other resources? Yes, it does.  Does this department need to be dismantled?  No, it does not.  You all have seen what the result of this tragic situation has caused.  One City Council member called this rise in shootings and homicides an “uptick” in crime.  It is so much worse than that. We are already suffering under one pandemic.  If this police department is dismantled, we will have another pandemic hitting our city.  I can’t even fathom the crime level spike this will cause, and the loss of life.   We must maintain the police department, or some level of it at all costs. In your plan, you talk about possible social workers replacing officers on some calls.  I agree with this.  If I might take it a step further, why not have a social worker partner up with an officer for all shifts?  The accountability factor would be there, and a civilian social worker would bring a different facet to handling a call.  A bulk of our call load involves a certain type of community interaction with our citizens, and not so much a law enforcement role.  Save the officer only cars for those priority calls that need a level of enforcement or direct action.   I don’t have much time left with the police department, as I’m closing in on 30 years, but I would like to see a department still exist for the newer officers on the department.  Please bring the change this city is looking for, move funding around, but please keep this police department Intact.  They are needed, especially in these trying times.  Also, keep our current Chief.  Arradondo is a man of virtue and high character, and is the best Chief of Police I have ever had the honor of working for.  Change begins at the top, and he is the man that can do it. Thank you for your consideration.  As a current resident that is proud to live in this city, and to serve it, I still believe that we can and shall be better."
"6/30/2020 7:08:51 AM",-41,"","","I have lived in Minneapolis since 1997 so I am no newcomer.  I am a former block club leader of some 7 years' duration until club members died or moved.  I am more than a little familiar with safety, organizing, contact with the City departments, dealing with police officers and working with crime prevention specialists, and so forth. That said, I regret to inform you that you cannot remove the police department altogether, lock stock and barrel.  How does the city propose to deal with the rise in violence since making their announcement?  The community at large perceived this as open season, free rein to do whatever they liked.  Over 100 shootings took place in the last 3 weeks alone.  This uptick in violence is well-documented, but there has been nary a peep from the council about it.  Why is that? In sound bites, Jeremiah Ellison claims ""...I think that it’s important for us to keep in perspective that most of what police do is not respond to violent situations.""  Does he mean that we have forced cops to take on multiple roles including that of social workers, mental health counselors, sleuths, inspectors, arbitrators, enforcers, bouncers, property seizures, and every other form of authority?  Absolutely, we have done that.  As a collective society we have invested in police all the negative, unpleasant tasks we'd prefer not to think about or do ourselves. Whether we realize it or not, whether we were targeted or we were the ones in power, this is what we did as a collective.  Is it any surprise that it has evolved into a brutish business, attracting the worst elements in humanity, and poisoning everything and everyone it comes into contact with? But the one incontrovertible fact that the council is apparently ignoring is this: crime exists, and will continue to exist so long as there are human beings.  Remember what I said about the worst elements in humanity?  Humans have done and will continue to do nasty, horrible things to one another, from time immemorial, out of fear, greed and malice.  Until all of humanity rises above those traits, we will have mean, violent and greedy individuals who need to be curbed and restrained from acting out their worst impulses, and punished if they do (and this includes police officers, as we know them now--    they are not exempt!). That said, this means there must be some group that will accept the nasty, dirty role of playing the heavy.  How do you propose to do away with this reality?  If you insist on feel-good measures like installing someone who has no law enforcement experience to lead a department of safety, I assure you the criminals will not be quaking in fear but rather planning their next operations.  It's simply the way it is.    Now, if this amendment passes, then I would expect this ""Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department"" to work toward ACCOUNTABILITY.  Read that again, all of you:  accountability, i.e taking responsibility for oneself and one's immediate environment.  This applies to us all, not just a few of us.  Accountability includes being civil, having an attitude of civic engagement, being productive in some way, and being constructively engaged, such as school, job or other meaningful structured activity.  This includes changing the community's tendency toward splintered families and absent parents, and ensuring real, meaningful and constructive activities for young people after school and in summer.  Drop the happy talk of ""privilege"" and ""holistic"" from all of your proposed charter changes, because by flinging such babble around, you're going to drive off support from the wider community that sees those terms as psychological twaddle and as flimsy excuses to let people evade accountability and just get ""free stuff"" that someone, I assure you, is paying for somehow, in some manner.   Like it or not, the City Council is going to have to include the input from the public who are moderate in their thinking, and yes, even conservative politically!"
"6/30/2020 7:09:29 AM",-21,"","","We avoid Minneapolis now because of crime. With no real policing we will simply never visit the city for entertainment, dining, etc.  Seems likely this plan will kill jobs, raise taxes, property will lose value and before you know it it will look a lot like Detroit. Citizens will not feel safe period. I  lived in Minneapolis years ago and never felt unsafe. Not true anymore when I go to see friends.  Watching open drug dealing, seeing pointless vandalism and plenty of theft. Citizens will feel more compelled to arm themselves if they cannot count on policing. There is no doubt tragedy will ensue if this occurs. Sending social workers to deal with domestic situations sounds insane as these situations are known to be very dangerous. Unless you arm these responders there will be dead responders."
"6/30/2020 7:09:35 AM",11,"","","I used to live in Minneapolis until my divorce last year and hope to move back soon. I am thrilled to see the direction Minneapolis is moving in terms of community response. In such, a great idea came from a friend: Treat emergency response like an IT support center. One number (911) to call and get routed appropriately. Setup simple staging of emergency of violence, physical abuse, robbery, fire; then a second tier emergency of physical health, mental health, mental/verbal abuse; then a tier of non emergency such as roadside assistance, city upkeep transfer to 411, or other services. I am sure you have call history which can be analyzed to show what types and how many calls are typical. You would not need to roll police, fire, and medical at all times. I do call 911 regularly to report minor issues or suspicious activity. The above has been my experience. I do believe a ""peace force"" of police who are still responsible to manage violence is necessary. The police I do know are skilled in this and is a niche that will not go away. With that said, not all crime requires guns and K9s. As a Burning Man type, I also want to see community rangers. People skills in de-escalation and medical to be initially involved in incidents and be a trusted bridge between city and community. There would need to be a vetting and continual monitoring system to ensure quality people. Rangers or other types could receive property tax breaks or Chamber of Commerce vouchers for their one weekend a month; like the National Guard. Side note: How are you going to manage local terrorism? A friend's story (yes I spoke direct to him) is: Over this past weekend, a white supremacist from Wisconsin with ""33"" tattoo was throwing bricks at Cup Foods and a mourner. The community safety team subdued him. Then after 911 directed them to two drop off locations,  MPD pushed my friend, refused to help, and then left without the guy even when there were multiple witnesses and video of vandalism and violence.  As long as these stories are planned for then I am excited for what your about to make the best city and communities I have ever known. THANK YOU for doing this!"

Those of you that want to disband them are completely out of your minds!!!!!! Are you going to come and make sure that we all get into work safely 7 days a week at 1:30am?? I don’t think so!!!

The Minneapolis Police Department obviously requires  additional training in deescalation, alternative restraint techniques, identifying when citizens are in medical crisis.  The Police Department should likely be increased in size.  That is what they did in the well cited Camden Police defunding.  How much will it cost to just rename the Department?

I also feel the city council is pushing this change to the charter quickly because they are riding on emotions and not facts and reality and want to push this through before the citizens can pause and really think about what is best for the city. I am also hearing from many Community leaders that the approach of defunding and or dismantling the Minneapolis Police department is NOT what they want, so, I feel the city council is NOT listening to the citizens of the city and making decisions on their own.

"6/30/2020 7:15:50 AM",-10,"","","I live on the boarder of Mpls and bike every day around the chain of lakes. I also frequent businesses in Uptown regularly. Since the unfortunate death of George Floyd, I feel much less safe in Uptown than ever before. Additionally, I am now constantly on the lookout for homeless encampments around the lakes and parks. In passing the Lyndale Farmstead Park on 40th & Bryant and seeing about 10-15 tents set up yesterday, I did not feel safe and will not bike past this area again. During my time spent last week at Cedar Lake East Beach, when the Park Patrol truck was there, I felt less safe than when both the Park Patrol & Mpls Police vehicles were both there. I believe disbanding the police will only further the crime, violence, drugs, and homelessness. The mentality of the police department needs to change. Simply hiring “minorities” does not solve the issue. I saw this firsthand when I got to know a Mpls police officer personally and spent time with him for a few years. He is Asian and racist against the black & Somali population. He was also an avid Trump supporter. I ended up severing my ties with him as a friend because I felt his viewpoints were hypocritical of his job. He also did not live in Mpls. Perhaps requiring officers to live in the communities they serve would be more effective. In addition, the head of the police union is also a public Trump supporter and I feel he underhandedly supports and promotes racism. It’s unfortunate that national political viewpoints have impacted our communities at a local level, but it is the government who is ultimately fueling the current racism, anger, and violence at a local level. People are also tired of being impacted by COVID-19 and patience is at a low point. I feel that these factors have further contributed to the unfortunate circumstances that unfolded. So dismantling the police force is not the solution. Allowing people to react violently against the police is not the solution either. Hiring more officers of color, providing proper education and mental health support for them, and encouraging officers to live where they work seems like a more effective approach. Lastly, homeless encampments in city parks does not promote safety in the community. It encourages congregation, drug use, trash and waste upkeep, and loitering. Look to other cities for homeless approaches. Evaluate city regulations and/taxes that are hurting local businesses and/or preventing them from being profitable (is the city over-taxing or regulating?) which is ultimately contributing to the creation of a homeless population. Are the homeless here legally to begin with? Is there more that the city could be doing to help people be employed and vital to the community than simply allowing them to camp in public parks and make these areas an eyesore and a safety issue? To be effective in regulating the community though, the city needs to have an actual police force in place. What are other city police (both locally and in other states) doing more effectively than Mpls?"

Tell me what social worker or any other agency is going to show up to these calls without police back up? Where is the money for both going to come from? I keep hearing all of you using Camden NJ as a model city.

This can be done without loss of public safety for white residents. That's the misnomer. That the current way keeps ""us"" safe. It does not.

This feeling of lack of safety and security and pride has never been caused by our police force.  The chief of police and pushover mayor who fail to weed out the very few bad eggs in our community shouldn't bring about these consequences to us or to the several wonderful members of the police force. These men and women now face mobs of people who view them as evil due to the failed actions of a terrible mayor when only 2 months ago were praised for their bravery in the face of a global pandemic and their ability to continue to provide a sense of safety and security to the community.

Be able to shoot the gun out of someone’s hand, or precisely hit them in the knee cap.  We expect them to be able to drop kick a suspect and never allow themselves to be overcome by someone. We need to provide this training. They can’t be overweight, they can’t have asthma, they must be physically fit.  We want them to be able to reason, de-escalate, bargain, out talk, and outwit. They have to be educated for this.  Our peace keepers should be an elite force that is highly trained so they are able to manage any situation without using deadly force. AND we have to pay for all of this elite training and they must be paid like the elite profession they will Have invested a lot of time and work to become.  In Japan if you do not stop when a policeman tells you to stop you are going to spend some time in jail. There is zero tolerance for breaking the law, or defying a policeman on the street.   Being a policeman needs to be something for an elite few. Education and physical training are key, and only those who earn the right to be a peace officer should become one. We need to pay them for the work, commitment, and time this will take. It should be a coveted position like a doctor or scientist. We expect a lot from our police force right now. We don’t provide the education they need to be successful.  We too often take the side of a law breaker because they lost their life, and we don’t pay our police nearly enough to have the expectations we have.

By dissolving some of their funding into a new directive, the people of Minneapolis would have other options for assistance when certain situations arise, instead of a gun-toting barely-trained officer, who more often than not, works escalate the issue instead of breaking it down and actually helping. In addition, it's incredibly wrong that a teacher, an architect, a nurse, or even a lowly Public Works employees like myself, receives more training that the MPD - and they carry weapons and do their jobs with an aire of arrogance.

Many nights were spent in front of the television when the news reported standoffs and the like while he was working, with us wondering if he was okay. (Pre-cellphones) He was once involved in a high speed chase in front of the former Pizza Shack, where I was working at the time. Look, you can change the name of the police to whatever you want, at the end of the day though you will need police to take care of criminals without allowing for vigilantes in your city running things. But when all you do is call the vast majority of the officers vile names and make outlandish accusations about them, you will lose all the great officers and you will be left with the less than desirable officers. Some of whom should never have been let through to a police department.  Sure, you can change aspects of how the department works, have a social worker tag along with an officer if you wish. Just ensure that they are trained in all the ways it could go wrong when they go to a domestic call. Have the ""nice"" person be the first to contact folks if you wish, just make sure there is an officer there to protect them when/if things go south.  Stop being cheap with the people you ask to defend you from ""bad"" guys. Spend some money on them. Hire more so the existing ones are not overworked.

(The City Council should be concerned that if the violence continues and the police can’t do their job - what the vacating rate might look like.) If better training and a change of culture is needed. That needs to come from within.  It needs to be said also that during the riots & demonstrations we  sure witnessed a lot of patience and poise by our police and National Guard.  I think what the city needs is more of a police presence not less."
"6/30/2020 7:40:21 AM",-24,"","","This is a bad idea for so many obvious reasons.  What is a ""Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department"" anyway?  How would that work?  I would like to know how many large metropolitan areas have utilized something like this, and what were the results.  No, I am not a resident of Minneapolis, but I do go there for entertainment occasionally - mostly Orchestra Hall.  As much as I love the orchestra, I would no longer be attending any concerts if the police department is abolished.   The crime and violence in Minneapolis is increasing exponentially, and a ""Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department"" is not going to protect the average law-abiding citizen from those who are motivated by evil, greed and destruction.   Are we moving towards a society where a person  needs to hire their own security and bodyguards in order to venture into the cities?  I am appalled at the actions of the City Council.  Like any other organization the MPD has issues and problems that need to be addressed and corrected.  That doesn't translate into throwing out the whole thing.   Does the City Council's flawed logic assume that this ""Safety and Violence Prevention Department"" is going to prevent and eliminate the gangs, drug-dealers, sexual predators, thieves and murderers?  I am certainly aware that the MPD cannot prevent them either but, you can bet that without the police department these bad elements would increase and have free-reign of our cities.  Let's come together, look beyond our differences, and improve what is already in place.  Let's not move towards anarchy and chaos.  Please reconsider this misguided notion and let common sense prevail."

If you want to dismantle the police, and instead rely on your neighbors and counselors to call when there is a problem, why do your city council members need their own private security detail, paid for by the citizens?? Does that come from 'a place of privilege' perhaps? Most people can not afford that luxury, that is why we need something called 'police'.  I have seen that you claim the recent violence has been happening even with the police. Actually, it's because you have given the criminals a green light. That's on you.  If this passes my family will never spend another cent in the city of Minneapolis. No sports games, no dining, no shopping. The businesses will die.

Every one of you knows that laws and their enforcement are a critical part of civilized societies, and if you don't you probably shouldn't be in the position that you are. I understand feeling a need to make changes within departments where there is trouble, but supporting community policing and the hundreds of really good officers who have sworn an oath to protect only to be vilified by you is an absolute embarrassment.  No, I'm not currently a resident of Minneapolis. I've worked in the city for many years. I've attended college in the city. I enjoy visiting many businesses of friends in the city. I also have a child who is currently living in and attending school in Minneapolis, and her younger sister had been consideringdoing the same until a lot of this nonsense began. I dont have a vote at the ballot box, but I can absolutely elect to stop going to Minneapolis. I'm sad I'll miss attending Twins games with my friends and family, but other than that I prefer knowing my family and friends will be protected from violent crimes.  Sure, you can disgard everything I say if you want. After all what can a guy living in the suburbs possibly know? Well, I grew up on the Eastside of Saint Paul. I watched as one of my best friends recieved consecutive life sentences for his role in a gang shooting during my senioryear of high school. I've been shot at, and witnessed my best friend take a bullet to the face...  A few years back I was physically assaulted by a deranged man and told to ""go vack to my own neighborhood"" while visiting the coffee shop next to my school in Minneapolis. Thankfully other members of his community were there to get him under control, but this could have had a much worse ending if not for the local police. I dont blame that man for punching me unprovoked, if I did he would have been hospitalized. No, I blame your style of divisive politics for getting this man so enraged that he thought punching a man twice his size was a good idea. I understand the importance of effective law enforcement and what crime does to communities and local economies. I'd prefer you admit you have no business holding the elected offices you're in before destroying a great city for political reasons. There is a solution, but what you're doing will end in disaster where innocent people, not you, will be forced to pick up the pieces, if they even can."

"6/30/2020 7:52:25 AM",-7,"","","Yes, we need to dismantle the existing corrupt MPD, get out from under its white-supremacist union and replace it with a new public safety agency focused on crime and violence prevention - but as I’m sure you have figured out, it still has to have some police in it! We will still have rapists and muggers and murderers and gang wars and not-so-petty thieves. Maybe we could do without armed officers in a nicer world with less poverty and the crime and substance abuse driven by poverty, but fixing that is beyond the scope of a public safety agency or even the city itself. I strongly support bigger societal changes to reduce those inequalities, but until we actually get them we will need police.  We do need a better policing model, one where cops are closer and more involved in the neighborhoods they patrol. There are better models than the broken “broken windows” approach apparently followed by MPD."

Some other type of (Law enforcement?) wouldn't change anything as people seem to expect no punishment for breaking laws. The killing of George Floyd was awful of course but get real, no PD? I wonder, did anyone call 911 during those 8 minutes to report to the PD that a murder by a police officer was in progress?  History, statues, flags, etcetera, there is much of that being destroyed now like it is going to change the past. Some people need to study the history here in the USA. How were things in the ""Wild West"" before law enforcement was established? Think of the terrible things that were inflicted upon, done to, good WOMAN, CHILDREN & Men!!! I said to someone a while back, some things/ideas are so ridiculous that thinking them is one thing but saying them out-loud is a no-no. This is one of them!!! I don't think it's a secret that Children of criminals of any race in many cases are taught that the Police are bad guys and to hate them. I don't worry about the Police as I am not breaking the law on a daily basis. In general, it pretty much comes down to this once a child is old enough to know better, when Mom or Dad say stop, you stop. When the teacher or the girlfriend & on & on & on say stop, you stop. Last but not least, when the Police say stop, YOU STOP. The murder of George Floyd cannot wipe out law enforcement. Why don't all the Politician's in all the big cities in the USA be required to live in the SLUMS, we'll see if they would like some law enforcement then!!!"

Presenting the issue to the public with out a clear, comprehensive description of what would replace aspects of policing and which aspects would remain (an important component given the rise in violent crime) risks the ballot measure failing. Do the work of planning And designing a replacement up front before you ask citizens to decide if they agree with you.  I thank you all for your service, particularly in the troubling time."
"6/30/2020 7:54:06 AM",-1,"","","The city of Minneapolis requires a complete overhaul of its public safety system. The police are called into too many incidents and situations where armed police are not the solution. In fact, the presence of arms in many such incidents merely serves to stress the involved parties, often resulting in catastrophic consequences. The lack of adequate support for social services, mental health resources and crisis negotiators in tense situations is disturbing. This is like trying to prune a shrub using a chainsaw, the police are not a one size fits all solution for every public safety crisis. I fully support the city's mission to defund the police in its current form and work towards an alternate public safety ecosystem. I sincerely hope that Minneapolis paves the way for sensible changes that will influence other neighboring cities, including my own, Plymouth."

Aunty (the matriark of ""the Family) holds the real sway in decisions about security but a 21 year old kid has been given the ""role"" as head of security. My brother owns a home on 37th and Bloomington av. . It's no secret to those familiar with the area that the Family (the Bloods) have owned that intersection for the last 40 years. The leaders of that area have ceded control of the alley on 38th street next to the mural of George Floyd to the Bloods where they are free to continue selling drugs completely unhindered by the police. If I am aware of this you can bet that Lt. Kroll is aware of this. In spite of his public persona as a bumbling fool (I liken him to Hochstetter on Hogan's Hero's) he is wicked smart. How else could he become the most powerful person in the Minneapolis police in a city that elected   Ilhan Omar? I imagine about the time this goes on the ballot he will bring Fox News over to the alley to demonstrate how the local leaders planning  our replacement for the police put the Bloods gang in charge of security.

They do not live in their communities, and they police them with limited training and unlimited bias and racism. Black people in this city face systemic violence and hatred against their bodies, lives, and communities, and this is just one step to fighting for equity in BIPOC communities. I live about five blocks out of the City of Minneapolis proper, and I see weekly, sometimes daily examples of police bias and racism. I personally, and members of my community have  had to stop and observe police conduct as it concerns their policing of Black people in my neighborhood, as we have come to the conclusion that we cannot trust police to protect those members of the community.

I hear gunshots every night, fireworks every night. Nobody's doing anything about it.  I used to work downtown at MacPhail. One night about two years ago a disturbed, mentally ill and possibly drunk guy came into the school and said ""gangs"" were chasing him. He pointed them out, and nobody was outside. Employees had to lock themselves in an office while I tried to reason with him, he finally agreed that I should call the police. I called 4 times in an hour while he became increasingly agitated I was told ""It's Saturday night, and we're really busy"". There were dozens of children in the school, just as many senior citizens.

Better to fire a bad officer early than deal with this.   I along with many friends in the area are looking to the outlying suburbs and considering a move.  It was fun while it lasted but I'm not interested in living in chaos.

Our neighborhoods are being trashed and terrorized, and no one is doing anything about it. We call 911, and often no one comes and no one seems to care. Before George Floyd was murdered, our neighborhood was actually pretty peaceful.  We didn't hear gunshots all the time at night. We weren't afraid to take walks and didn't worry about getting mugged in broad daylight. We have people shouting through megaphones for hours and hours without rest, which makes it hard to get work done during a pandemic, but more frightening are all of the gunshots and arson attempts. We have people routinely driving down Park Avenue at highway speed, and it's dangerous, and should be pretty easy to fix if police were here to pull them over. What is needed right now is more good, well trained police presence, not less. While I do see a role to play in incorporating people with different skills and having someone with more experience in addiction and mental health issues responding to some calls, that's not what we're often suffering from right now. We need better trained police with deescalation training, and a department culture that takes it seriously from the top down, and recommends non-violent responses whenever possible.  We are being terrorized in our neighborhoods with violence right now. We need a law enforcement response. It feels like right now no one is speaking for the residents, and instead, our leadership is reacting out of fear of more demonstrations. It feels like a knee-jerk reaction instead of a solid long-term plan that would include, at least for now, a solid law enforcement response to stop the violence and chaos now.  Maybe long term defunding could be talked about. But right now, you need to stop the bleeding, or our neighborhood will no longer be safe and livable for its residents."

Everyone with half a brain knows the police union is a big part of the problem. The system needs to allow for the ""bad"" officers to be terminated without fear of legal action. The other major factor is how most are portraying the idea o racism. I understand it exists but there are also many black citizens who understand they need to be responsible to change their own culture from within. Why dont leaders choose to listen to those people? It's because they dont scream as loud. When Justine Damond was killed, you didnt see white people lash out in a violent frenzy yet violence seemed to be the first guy reaction people had when George Floyd was killed. I'd love to have someone examine why that difference exists in our cultures--fix THAT instead of spending time and money to only make things worse!

Finally to have officers to get out in their communities and show that they are there for us not against us.  I am so very disappointed in my city and the sure stupidity we have shown.  What is amazing is that we have had  ""democratic"" mayors running our city for over 40 years and  city councils that have been predominantly the same and yet these people have done nothing to change things for the ""people"" they say they represent.

I urge the council to drop this effort, spend the next year developing a plan with full public input, and then put it on the ballot in 2021. It should also be noted that 120 people have been shot in the city in the last month. The city already does little to nothing to combat property crime (even telling people on the city website to call 311 instead of 911). Provides no traffic enforcement. And the Chief of Police has already asked for a major increase in police officers.  The city is failing to keep us safe."

There should be more officers that live in Minneapolis and care about the community and not see it as a military zone. Please look into options of serious reform and weeding out racist and problematic officers. I do think we need policing in the community but not in its current state.

While violent crime is on the rise, people and businesses are being told that we are on our own and while I agree that an individual is responsible for their own safety and that the police do not have a duty to protect, there must be a large, visible presence in some areas of the city to ensure that order is maintained."

Because right now Minneapolis is an extremely dangerous place to be.  And if individual citizens are forced to protect themselves and their property, things are going to get a whole lot more violent. Let's start by taking away the City Council's security guards, effective immediately.  Let them feel what it's like to not have protection.  Then disband the City Council.  Save that money, and put it into better policing.  Our city council incited riots and created destruction, they should be immediately kicked out of office, without waiting for an election in November.  They have made a laughing stock of Minneapolis on an international stage, as they sit there cowering behind their security guards.  But worse, they have made Minneapolis unsafe for everyone, including the minorities they claim to support.  Every citizen in Minneapolis should get better protection than these hypocrites are demanding for themselves. Wake up.  These riots were not peaceful protests.  Stop encouraging more violence.

I can't protect anything or defend or give proof to anyone about anything.  An abusive parent can still have time with their kids becaue there is not physical proof (aka police report/police  taken photos/evidence) to show a court.  I have had lawyers tell me a father abused one kid can't see that kid but can see their other kid because there is no proof he hurt that kid.   How messed up is that?  They system not just police has failed families over and over.   And who is to say a therapist is going to protect the domestic violence call even when there is no imminent threat to danger present.  It only takes one second for an abuser to go haywire or be triggered into anger and bam someone would be dead.  But oh no the wholistic approach was supposed to work right???  All it takes is one minute for a person who was doing ok to grab that kitchen knife or strangulate someone.....a counselor can do that and take care of that situation???  this is so wrong and I am scared for our future.  the therapist is trained in first aid/emergencies/can tackle someone/use force if need be as peaceful situations can turn deadly in an instant.

I have lost any interest in going to downtown Minneapolis or even uptown now for fear of safety.  The city council keeps mentioning one town Camden that has done this.

They have no willingness to reform, and treat Minneapolis like a hostile territory in which they are an army of occupation. Until they learn to respect and love Minneapolis like we citizens do, they can stay home in their all white exurbs. We can keep the peace ourselves.

Please stop trying to be political activists and actually listen to what the residents of your city want/need (govern the city). Go knock on doors and talk to people instead of isolating yourselves from your city. You lost control of the city following the murder of George Floyd. You need to restore control and confidence of all residents, before any policy changes can occur with any degree of confidence. You can’t do that without police. What does getting rid of the police department accomplish? Does it solve racial inequity? It is an extremely knee jerk reaction, and it is painfully obvious that you are all in over your head and making this “plan” up as you go along. Stop. You may be privileged enough to have private security, but most of us are not. Get rid of the security and come talk to your citizens. I saw Andrea walking down my block a couple days ago, and was going to go outside to talk to her. I stopped when I saw the clearly armed guard walking a few steps behind her. Having armed guards, with no uniform walking our otherwise safe city streets creates a very eerie/scary backdrop to try to engage in discussion about the future of our city.

The problem is, and has been for decades, the inability or unwillingness of the city to set standards, establish policies and procedures, and enforce them regarding the police department.  The lame excuse that the police union is in fact running the police department, or at least preventing effective management of it, doesn't hold water and never has.  We are to believe that this particular union has powers so daunting that the city cannot identify and remove bad actors.  I'm not buying it.  If arbitration has to be restructured, now is the time to do it.  Why should any citizen of Minneapolis believe that the city can somehow manage a new 'public safety' organization, including law enforcement people, any better than they have managed the current police department.  While you're wasting your time with this the city needs effective policing.  The people who need it the most are the ones in the highest crime areas.  You had better get a move on, rather than kicking the can down the road.  The mob is still out there, waiting for the next atrocity, real or perceived, to trigger their rioting, looting and arson.

"6/30/2020 8:22:35 AM",-18,"","","I think that the police in Minneapolis should be structured as peacekeepers of the city not the military type policing that has caused harm to its residents especially of color. There training should be different than what they are doing now. There should be training for emotional mental also a facet of training to know when other agencies should be called in at the same time they are so it can be handled without escalating to the violence I have seen on the streets of Minneapolis. At one time I was becoming a probation officer for Ramsey County. Even though I finished my degree in Human Services/Corrections I did a drive along with a police officer; I worked 6 months in Ramsey county juvenile detention center; I worked in a treatment center for 13-18 year olds; I found that what they were asking of me to do - the type of training to be effective in keeping myself safe and the client was more than I could handle. It was not in my nature to treat people that way. So I walked away from it.  I think that the whole country as a whole needs reforming. They are supposed to be protecting us from harm yet they are causing more harm. There are a few bad apples in society yet there are some in the police who should be police officers. Better screening needs to be done for their mental health their attitudes towards people of all cultures especially those of color. We need officers who become part of the community live in the community so they get to know their neighbors like I remember you had to live within city limits inorder to work as an officer of that police department. Life was less violent and people know they could trust the police. Now it’s a different story. The name law enforcement needs to be changed so that it represents peacekeeping of the peace in the city. I remember when the police used ride horses around the city made them easier to talk with and get to know them. With them in their cars it’s harder to know them more afraid to approach. It makes for a scarier time when you need help. Being pursued by the police being stopped for something because of the color of your skin and them assuming have committed a crime before getting the whole story and then end up dead is awful. Things need to change in the way people are treated. Where is the fact that you are innocent until proven guilty. Thank you for allowing me to send in my comments even though I am not a resident of Minneapolis. I have friends who live there."

Approximately 26-28% of those that come back, are treated for their PTSD leaving about 70% of those combat veterans, almost all of whom have PTSD untreated. The pool from which police officers are selected, needs to be examined. If they are not treated for PTSD, the Minneapolis are inheriting the problems that come with that. Most of that comes from fear and trigger happiness. The hiring body for police officers should consist of a variety of different people - including administrators, and former veterans that are being treated.

I understand the need for law enforcement as a division of the new proposed plan, and want to understand what that would look like, how it would be managed and carried out, and how to have an effective but transparent way of dealing with crimes ranging from petty to serious. I don't know that we will ""get it right"" on the first try but I am hopeful to see a city moving towards something drastically different than what we currently have.

The police are not God and should be accountable for their actions. Punishment should be doubled because they are in a position that is suppose to keep peace not destroy it. They should be aware of the power they have and be responsible for what they do. Also, the culture needs to change, rewards for deesculating situations, living and meeting the people in the same area they patrol etc.   In this era of technology, there is no need to shoot someone in the back.

You must not, because councilmembers have requested armed security.  If you are scared and don't enjoy the environment that you have created, imagine how your citizens feel....

I am for reducing police brutality by increasing transparency and changing rules on techniques like knees on necks, but I don't support reducing the numbers of police in the city which is what this change seems to be aimed at doing. Using the Rayshard Brooks case as an example, it is tragic he ended up getting shot, but it is not my belief that a peaceful officer could be dispatched to handle a guy reportedly drunk driving. Drunk driving is deadly dangerous to the community, so an officer authorized to use force should be dispatched, and if the suspect resists arrest, I believe they should be forcefully captured to be processed through the system. In the case of George Floyd, I don't know enough details of what happened inside the store to comment on the type of officer to deploy. However, I'm totally a fan of someone being present that can use force. Otherwise, we are going to see people just running from your 'peace officers' and getting away with things. Then they tell their friends, and more crime happens. This is likely to hurt the black community more than it helps.

It was incredibly disheartening, gut wrenching and sad to watch our beautiful and beloved City burn in the days following Memorial Day with no leadership to be seen or heard. No meaningful deterrence was made until it was too late. Too many businesses were lost or damaged. And worse, the failed leaders set the tone for the months of extraordinary violence to follow. Do we need change in the Minneapolis police? Yes. I have no doubt the City Council wants what is best for its residents and daily commuters. But what the City Council is proposing will cause irreparable damage in the long term. Rather than abolishing/defunding/disbanding the MPD, I challenge this Council to create the best trained, highest paid, and most technically proficient and effective police force in the country. To do this we need better, more qualified officers with higher funding and more consistent and mandatory training. No more officers with only 2-year degrees.  No more officers hiding behind their police union. It starts with quality hires, increased funding, increased training and end with accountability. Please also offer training for the public on how to react when encountering police."

"6/30/2020 8:34:23 AM",-8,"","","I am not a resident of Minneapolis, but I work there and go to the city for sporting events, dining, and other entertainment.  Like everyone I was distressed at the deaths of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks.  But I think eliminating or defunding the police department is going way too far.  What I do think needs to happen is a change in the culture of the police department.   In the case of George Floyd, the culture that 3 other officers would just stand by and allow him to be killed is unacceptable and the culture that allowed that needs to change.  We all have a responsibility to do the right thing and when those around us are not doing the right thing we need to take action to stop them!  That those three officers did nothing says to me the culture in the department is wrong and needs to change.   are part of a ""pattern of excessive police violence toward Black people,"" a poll released Tuesday shows.   In the case of  Rayshard Brooks, the culture needs to change from ""Law Enforcement"" to ""Keeping the Peace""  Rayshard posed no threat to anyone, he had a little to much to drink.  If the officers had been focused on ""Keeping the Peace"" they would have call someone to come get him, call a cab, or even taken him home themselves."
"6/30/2020 8:34:26 AM",-2,"","","I believe that the Minneapolis Police Department has lost its way. I believe unequivocally that it has in the past, and continues today, to discriminate against people of color. I believe that Lt. Bob Kroll has been a main part of the roadblocks to rehabilitation. I do not believe he is solely responsible. He was elected by his peers and continues to be re-elected by them, therefore they share in the culpability.  I do not see a way forward with the current police federation or the department as a whole. I believe in defunding and reallocating many of the resources that are currently invested in the MPD, and I believe a new department should be formed which includes officers of the peace for emergency response, working in conjunction with mental health professionals and social workers. I believe that these officers should be required to live in the neighborhoods which they patrol. I believe the department should be disbanded and reformed from the ground up, with all personnel being required to reapply for their jobs, and approval being given by a citizen-led commission.  I agree that there are needs in the community that would be better served through mental health care professionals and I also believe that community outreach should be a major source of investment to help break the institutional and systemic racism that has a foothold in every aspect of society. We need programs for the underserved, particularly people of color.  However, I also believe that a well-trained police department does serve a purpose. I believe that a new department should be de-militarized and I think extensive training in deescalation should also be a major component of the department culture.  I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that the department should be abolished and that citizens should fill in the void. While new social programs will help to slowly change the paradigm of the situation for people of color, there will always be violent criminals, rapists, drunk drivers, and opportunists from all walks of life.  Community patrols cannot and would not be effective in deterring or detaining these people. I think an armed civil patrol would be a nightmare and an unarmed civil patrol would be worse. If my home is being broken into by armed robbers, it is insane to think that my only course of action is to call a neighbor. And then what? We do not live in a utopia.  How do you suppose businesses would get their insurance underwritten if there is absolutely no police force? You would automatically have a mass exodus of businesses for that reason alone.  I have seen so many points of view on what defunding the police means, and everyone seems to assume that everyone shares the same belief. So we need to be careful and clear about what this new vision is. It needs to be in writing, with discussion and input from everyone in our city. And it needs to happen before the charter is amended. You cannot remove the police department without a robust plan in place, and what we've heard so far is that November is too soon to both come up with a new plan and amend the charter.  The world is watching and political posturing does not score style points if the ballot measure fails because this city rightfully thinks it is insane to remove the police without a plan.  Businesses will leave en masse, either because they don't believe their assets will be protected OR because insurance companies will not insure them without a law enforcement presence. And people will also leave, making real estate prices plummet, which affects the property taxes that you depend on.  This is an almost certainty, and it does not need to happen. You can avoid this by coming up with a plan first. Do not try getting the cart ahead of the horse - the majority of us want change... real and lasting change. But we need to be smart about it or nothing will happen."

"6/30/2020 8:39:35 AM",5,"","","As a Minneapolis resident I am highly disturbed by the comments of the city council members to ""disband"" the Police yet offer no guidance what if anything would replace them. That being said Police reform is absolutely needed. I approve of the desire to change it where Mental Health Professionals and Paramedics are dispatched to the appropriate situations in lieu of the Police. The personnel levels of these additional professionals should be spelled out within the updated department charter and approved by popular vote much like the current Police personnel levels are so as to prevent future political desires to shift those resources back to the Police.      One thing not talked about that should be considered is shifting the liability of Police lawsuits to the Police Union should they refuse to allow proper personnel management of officers - i.e. the City/Police Department is unable to terminate officers or forced to accept their reinstatement after arbitration. Separately but related, I would support a city charter amendment that prohibited anyone negotiating or accepting union agreements that allow for those types of job protections in the contract."

I also think downtown keeps deteriorating and is less and less desirable to visit. With all of this going on in the city, defunding the police seems like a horrible idea.  I was a former home owner in the city and currently rent in the city. I don’t think I am going to purchase another house in Minneapolis and will most likely move to the suburbs in the near future due to the uncertainty about what will happen. My feeling is that if I need the police in the future, they won’t be available and I will be forced to deal with whatever problem I’m facing personally which may not always be appropriate."

It’s like having kids in a home and removing the parents. They will not learn respect, discipline, how to take direction, how to be a good follower, how to treat others as you’d like to be treated etc. you will see entitlement grow, you will see a free for all with no police force to keep law and order.

Rest assured though, if the police are defunded and de-established, I will NOT, ever, bring my family to a Twins game, to a Wolves game, to the Guthrie, to anything in Minneapolis.  EVER.  The murder and crime rate will go through the roof. Minneapolis will be a cesspool of crime.  People And companies will flee to the suburbs By the thousands.

"6/30/2020 8:43:55 AM",9,"","","While I am in support of replacing the police department, I am concerned about the Council's rush to do so without providing concrete details on what the new system of public safety will look like. I would feel much more comfortable voting in favor of the amendment if the Council presents more concrete details on their plans for replacing the MPD ahead of the vote in November. In light of the recent spike in violent crime and shootings in the city, I want to feel confident that any plans to replace the MPD will ensure greater safety for all residents."
"6/30/2020 8:44:05 AM",2,"","","I am excited to see the City Council taking the initiative to enact lasting change in the Minneapolis Police. To make such change successful, however, it is necessary to outline how ALL aspects of the police will be replaced. The shift toward public health and mental health services is fantastic, but the need will also remain for armed responses in the event of violent crimes such as hate crimes, mass shootings, and murders to name a few. I am glad to know that armed officers will not be present more often than necessary, but I implore the Council to lay out at least a draft of how the new policing system could look. Would armed officers be local or would they be dispatched from the County Sherriff or State Patrol? Sketching out some of these plans would go a long way toward fostering unity behind the replacement of the police. Most effort has been spent convincing opponents that it is RIGHT. I believe that the next important step, which has been missing, is to show that it is POSSIBLE and that it is SAFE. Then, we can move forward together. And to do so, it is imperative that the Council bring to the table the local NAACP chapter and other members of the Black community rather than listening only to a few. Thank you for your attention."
"6/30/2020 8:44:30 AM",-5,"","","I agree with Andrea Jenkins in that you can change the name, the organization and responsibilities, however if you don't actually change the culture of racism then what are you really accomplishing besides saving face?   I believe that any police officer (or whatever there new name is going to be) who is going to be called on to ""police"" our Minneapolis communities needs to be apart of these communities. I feel very strongly that if they were to be involved with and become ingrained into the same communities we need them to protect, they might treat their neighbors differently when called to intervene.  Just like some outside influences turned the protests violent weeks ago and burned down my neighborhood, the same can be said of cops who live outside our communities and go to work with no connection or care for the communities they patrol. The people living there are seen as criminals first, suspects first instead of neighbors first. I would caution against eliminating the police department entirely. It would be a very slippery slope to try and walk back up if proposed community responses, social workers, mental health workers and others are either unable to perform how we ideally would like them to or if they are met with force and resistance to take advantage of their lack of power and enforcement.  This is a tough task and fine line that needs to be walked. I think any radical change that is pushed through quickly will be met with a lot more resistance even from those who might support it because of the fear of uncertainty. Let takes it slow, push incremental change but keep pushing. You need to show us that what you're saying and doing is actually working and not just words for print."

Minneapolis Police appear to have a chip on their shoulders, but are caring people when you see beyond the chip and they have a lot of experience.     I have worked with social workers and feel they cannot begin to deal with some of the problems the police deal with.    Why not clean up the police and keep them.? I feel this young city Council is way off on their plans and pray they are stopped."

"6/30/2020 8:45:36 AM",-12,"","","I strongly object to the current proposal as I understand it. It is a too-rapid response to political situation, even political pandering that is not yet thought through. I agree with the need for a radical cultural and procedural change, but not at the expense of public safety. This is a primary responsibility of city government. We must have a plan for what will replace it that we can all weigh in on and feel that our safety won't be compromised nor the well-being of African American people.  Right now there IS NO PLAN TO REPLACE POLICE. The City Council has said that will take a year to develop. Therefore, I urge the Charter Commission to vote 'NO"" to changing the city charter NOW, especially in light of all the community violence we are experiencing each and every day.   1. There is no plan to replace the current police department to provide security to citizens and business. 2. A disproportionately white population of folks who don't live in North Minneapolis and non-Northsiders are behind dismantling the police. Most African American folks I know demand that the police  radically transform by any means necessary but don't want announcements about getting rid of the police now. Our children are being shot and killed on our streets. Protecting them is our #1 priority– Not politics!  3. The City Council's announcement that it plans on dismantling the police is immature, premature and dangerous. We are in the middle of the greatest crime and violence spree in our neighborhood since 1996  when Minneapolis was known as 'Murderapolis.' Now is not the time to tell those committing unchecked violence daily that we are getting rid of the police. This has become a license to kill and shoot.  4. Under the new charter the new 'department of safety,' would report to 14- Council people who are responsible for different parts of the city that have different needs. Currently the police are held accountable by the Mayor and Police Chief. 14 bosses are too many! 5. We haven't fully supported nor given a real chance to the first African American police chief, Arradondo. He has already stepped up and refused to negotiate with the police union– something which no other chief has done before.  6. The timing on this is just bad. Let's get a plan and possibly put something on the ballot next year. Not now. Copy all messages to: City Clerk at casey.carl@minneapolismn.gov. AND Charter Chair Barry Clegg. Charter Committee members: Clegg, Barry Sandberg, Jan Ginder, Peter S Abbott, Gregory Cohen, Dan Smith, Christopher  Garcia, Jill Schwarzkopf, Lyall Giraud-Issaacson, Al Kozak, Andrew Lickness, Barbara Metge, Jana  Newborn, Toni  Perry, Matt  Rubenstein, Andrea Thank you."
"6/30/2020 8:45:45 AM",-12,"","","This is one of the most irresponsible things the council has ever done. And that is saying quite a bit. To move to dismantle the MPD without a plan in place but to “figure it out at a later date” .... that is nothing short of insane. As a resident of downtown Minneapolis this makes me very nervous. To the point I am considering the need to get a gun of my own. I do not support this at all and will vote against and campaign against it. I also find it interesting that on one hand you want to disband the police with no plan which clearly shows a very cavalier attitude towards our safety your own members have personal security. Walk your talk. If you so want this new Wild West, you as well should have to live with and in the consequences. All the shootings and stabbings going on and yet you still think this is a good idea??? This is a knee jerk reaction to recent events which will only give the green light to the people already committing crime. I would invite all of you, particularly Lisa Bender, to ride LRT very early in the morning or very late at night. Alone. Even waiting for the train is an adventure. Or just navigate downtown without being harassed and accosted. Before this we didn’t have enough police presence to rein in the crime downtown and now you want to get rid of it completely. Downtown will never bounce back with this “plan” or I should say complete lack of one. Give up your private security and walk your talk city council. While you can before you are all voted out. I’ve already sent you an email expressing my concerns and never got a single reply from any of you. Clearly I need to be more vocal with my opinion and trust when I say I am not the only one who feels this way. People are already scared to come downtown and with this new “no plan” have said they simple won’t ever. Good job on killing my neighborhood."
"6/30/2020 8:46:42 AM",-3,"","","The proposal related to Establishing Community Safety & Violence Prevention Department is as vague and undefined as the current charter provision relating to Police (Section 7.3). Under current section 7.3, the Mayor is given considerable power to make rules and make special orders. Is this charter amendment necessary to achieve the presumed goal of changing the culture of the police department and providing a change in who would respond to particular calls to 911 for citizen assistance? I urge the Mayor and the City Council to work together under the current charter to these ends. Either way, please provide definitions for key terms - such as ""police""."
"6/30/2020 8:46:44 AM",12,"","","I support this charter amendment as a step toward creating a community safety system that better meets residents’ mental and physical health needs and finally addresses ongoing human rights abuses by MPD.  Our family lives just across the river into Saint Paul, but my husband and I both work and go to church with our two children in Minneapolis. We also spend a significant amount of time shopping, dining and socializing there.  Even as a white woman, my interactions with the Minneapolis police have demonstrated that MPD is not making Minneapolis communities safer. Instead, as the video of George Floyd’s murder shows, MPD seems to take pride in disrespecting and at times terrorizing citizens. My white husband and I experienced this recently on the 35 W bridge as MPD fired rubber bullets at a group of us attempting to flee to safety after a tanker truck was allowed to enter a closed freeway and almost slammed into a peaceful protest we were part of. Our friends up ahead were sprayed with tear gas by MPD as they stood on the side of the highway - already traumatized by the tanker truck - waiting to figure out how to proceed. Instead of helping us, police further traumatized us. My husband and I left accepting that we live in a failed state where the National Guard was called in to protect police in their efforts to terrorize peaceful protesters voicing heartache over the murder of yet another resident at the hands of the police. Isn’t this the kind of conduct we demonize authoritarian regimes for?  I’m a licensed mental health provider and know so very many of the tragic situations that have escalated into violence because police were called in could be avoided and residents could get the help they need and deserve by an array of other service providers. I want community cultural healers, social workers, drug and alcohol counselors, employment coaches, youth mentors and more to be included in our vision of what community safety means. Imagine reallocating even just the amount the City pays out in settlements to address police brutality lawsuits to actually meet residents’ mental and physical needs - housing, food, education, employment opportunities, counseling, access to arts, libraries, parks and investment in the areas of our cities most impacted by redlining, racial covenants and ongoing disinvestment. This is the kind of community I want to work and worship in. In fact the predominantly white neighborhood in Saint Paul where my family and I live is already virtual free of any police presence because we have access to all of the above and have been positively impacted by racist systems that advantage us as white people. We can look to neighborhoods like ours to see what resources are required for people to live in virtually police-free communities. Thank you for reviewing this charter amendment and taking this necessary step toward creating a safer future for those of us who work, worship, play and live in Minneapolis."
"6/30/2020 8:46:53 AM",1,"","","We don't need to change the charter but we do need to change the mission and make-up of our police force.  Police should be required to live within Minneapolis.   We need more minority police officers, and they need to be out working and interacting with the public they serve.   In addition mental health workers should be part of the teams.    The control of the police federation must be changed.   Police officers work for the city not the federation.   They don't pay their salary.   I do and all residents of Mpls do in our taxes.

"6/30/2020 8:47:02 AM",-2,"","","While I have been an advocate for and proponent of change to our city’s police department as it stands today, reading the proposed charter changes left me very concerned.  The vague language around “police” requirements and the change to grant full power to city council gives me significant pause.  Where does oversight and governance come from?  What would stop city council from disbanding our police department without a proper and well-planned out alternative?  What avenues do we have to stop the changes that city council would now have full power to make should we find them to be ill conceived?    I understand this vague language mirrors that of other departments such as public works, who also have high budgets.  This; however, is a poor comparison.  Enforcement in any jurisdiction is important to be well-defined for a multitude or reasons, not the least of which is to ensure government is appropriately LIMITED.  Further, departments such as public works are heavily regulated via other means such as budgets, capital planning, zoning, city codes, utility policies, city economic development policies, and additional regulations that are too many to list.  Again to my earlier question – where does this oversight and regulation come from related to the police department other than from specific language in the charter? Given that Camden, NJ was spoken of as an example with regards to the path Minneapolis is considering, why do we not acknowledge that this proposed amendment goes much further than the City Code of Camden with regards to the management of the police force?  In fact, Camden made nearly no changes to their charter when they changed their police force.   As it stands, the language allows for any action to be taken, by city council or for a reactionary move by those that come after the current city council. I support change. But I want the best solution for Minneapolis, not the fastest."

Black children are taught to fear policemen by their parents so of course they are going to run and refuse to listen when they are stopped. You have heard parents speak of having the “talk” with their sons.  This is not just a police problem. We need to work with Black families to change their perception of the police department and provide opportunities for positive interactions.

Having a community of safety and violence prevention isn’t going to scare a real criminal like the police do. If a woman gets rapped or a home gets robbed or a business gets broken into the big bad community of violence of safety and violence prevention isn’t going to scare a criminal. The reason why criminals try to cover their tracks is so that the police don’t find them. If you abolish that a person can go out in broad daylight and commit crimes because there’s no one to stop them or take them in for real crime investigation. There needs to be reform within the police department, but abolishing it is just asking for a purge.

They need more modern training for what is going on in today's world.  More effective methods to handle those challenges.  Does that require less money? No, unfortunately it needs more.  The department needs to hire better officers.  Those individuals will (and should) demand more.    Honestly, I do not want to participate in a sociological/societal experiment here.  I don't believe in pixie dust and unicorns.  City wants to go this direction my first course of action will be giving my building a vacate notice.

My concern is that you will drive inequality higher, as people who can afford to vacate your city will, then housing prices will drop if people don't feel their property or safety are protected, and those who are left will have violence done to them by their own government ignoring its need to provide for public safety.

As we adventure the great city of MPLS. Sadly with a rapid decline of interest in exploring MPLS, my business insurance company informing me certain coverages would be more expensive and some things not covered at all if this goes through, as calls and violent crime have been on the rise rates were already increasing, and with calls taking far longer, shot spotter revealing the volume of shots fired, I cannot in good conscience continue to support the city, the local businesses, or put my clients in harms way.  I hope calmer clearer minds prevail as I know Saint Paul has social workers and homeless teams etc. they are asking for additional officers as they all want uniformed officers with them. Social workers have been assaulted and are declining to go to calls without officers.  I believe changes in MPLS are needed. But not by defunding. I think we need to pour into the Department. Increased educational requirements for new hires, increased pay to attract the best away from the suburbs who are paying much more for far less calls and risk. I believe with more officers you could respond more quickly to incidents, regain public safety and could accompany specialty services to calls when needed for mental health needs, social work, drugs etc.  I know the police chief asked for several hundred additional officers last fall. Everyone seems to respect him. I don’t understand why he was declined since there is a great need.  From my understanding, a department that doesn’t have enough officers can’t engage in community outreach and community building when they are too busy handling calls.  I would love to see Police in the community of my business when NOT on a call, simply engaging with their community as I have seen in Saint Paul. I know they have done lots of changes in the past few years with engagement and outreach  as I do lots of work there too. It is evident. I do miss the horses as I thought they were a positive police engagement.  Saint Paul will be my new hub for my business,, unless, they too make irrational decisions, while I await MPLS And their decision.

On that note - who is going to want to operate a business in Minneapolis, especially downtown?  I can tell you I will no longer be going to restaurants, bars, sporting events, concerts downtown if there is even less of a police presence there.  I was already apprehensive about it.  My stepdaughter works downtown and she has said she won't even feel comfortable going to work anymore.   I am a die-hard Minnesotan, but I am embarrassed by how Minneapolis has handled this murder and the fallout from it.  We are considering moving out of state depending on how the situation is handled from now on.  I know many people in Minneapolis who are planning to move.  And the fact that 3 city council members get private security is the most asinine, hypocritical thing ever.  Just WOW.

I am certain they have ideas in place to answer to virtually every question a nervous public might have concerning the abolition of the police force. Second, the police must be defunded into complete and total abolition--this does not mean reallocating money to ""community service officers"" or increased surveillance cameras and/or facial recognition technology. It means a fundamental shift from a culture of policing and punishment to one of early intervention and prevention. ALL of the money from the police department should be focused in increasing social support services in communities most affected by crime and therefore with the most police presence. Do not allow this to become a fight over funding for certain neighborhoods over others. We need to invest in the most at-risk neighborhoods first and foremost, as they are going to feel the difference from lack of police in both good and bad ways. Let the council members of color and communities lead the way--white MN politicians often take a paternalistic stance over marginalized communities and while those intentions may be noble, it's incredibly patronizing and just further removes the power these folks need to direct their own lives the way the rest of us have a right to do. Please be transparent. Admit your own personal weak spots and biases. Please speak often to the concerns raised by community members who are uncomfortable or opposed to the idea of a city without police--they are your voters and they are community members too. Please allow POC to take the lead on reforms and make it clear through your actions that you are working with the community, not against it or above it or outside of it. Lastly--y'all are doing the right thing in removing the police and I believe that with my whole heart.

I learned as a child that every on this Earth has hopes, dreams, fears, triumphs, and that we are all in the game of life together. That said, I am no stranger to discrimination. I have Cerebral Palsy. I have been bullied, I have been looked down upon as ""stupid"" and ""less than normal"" I was told growing up that the world was not made for me and I was destined to fail in it.  There is a parallel here, While I am not discriminated by race, I have seen my own version of it because of my disability. While I do respect, and rely on the police...I do fear the police. With all the negative media coverage; with all the interviews, stories, and videos of police abusing, belittling, and killing the people they have sworn to protect, I am afraid. I am afraid of the time where I will need to scream ""I am not resisting I have Cerebral Palsy!"" I am afraid of the one day I will stumble in front of a officer, and get shot as retaliation for a perceived attack. These are my fears, these are fears that have also been met with ""you're just being dramatic"" ""it wont happen"" and ""they're trained better than that."" There are parallels here. As far as a solution, The police do a job that we are too afraid to do ourselves, they are the heroes. They -are- the ones we call when we do truly need help. I believe it is very unwise to feed the current state of negativity, with a negative response. We need a community centered, non union regulated solution. We, as citizens deserve the right, to influence who we have protecting us, and relieve those who dont. It is my belief that while a side arm or a rifle is a tool to protect, it is too readily available to be used as the ""first and only solution"" It is my hope that more reliance on less than lethal options will one day be seen as the standard tool. I believe more community out reach is necessary. Police are always shown as figures of power and authority but no one knows the person behind the badge, after the end of their shift. It must be very...lonely as a officer. If they try to be friendly to a person, that same person thinks they have committed a crime, and will get shot. If a large number of people are saying the same thing there has to be truth behind it, I hope that all the -appropriate- actions will be taken. Thank you for your time."
"6/30/2020 9:03:38 AM",-14,"","","Dear Minneapolis Charter Commission, I am writing to you as someone who currently works in Minneapolis. For 20 years, I lived in the Stevens Square and Whittier neighborhoods (just south of downtown Minneapolis), where I witnessed police misconduct on many occasions.  The Minneapolis police have a history of violence and corruption that goes back for decades.  How many scandals do we have to endure before the city finally agrees to make a change? The police are supposed to be protecting us, but who protects us from them? George Floyd was murdered in cold blood, live on camera, because the cops thought that they could get away with it.  A badge shouldn't be license to commit crimes. Does anyone remember the multiple scandals involving the Vice Squad? Does anyone remember the Metro Gang Strike Force? --these were cops who stole money and cars from local residents, and most of them are still on the force!  We all know someone who has been beaten without provocation or hospitalized as a result of police brutality. The MPD cannot be reformed, it needs to be dissolved, and the officers should be forced to re-apply for their jobs under a non-union contract. It is time for police to face some real financial consequences for their behavior. The thin blue line cannot stand.  I support efforts to create a new department of public safety in place of the current MPD. Peace officers are needed to help protect citizens against violent crimes, but they should not be doing mental health checks or performing other services that are better left to trained professionals. Citizen residents will be better served if the City redirects our tax dollars away from policing towards other social service agencies and other public services."

If you abolish police force I guarantee the residents will vote you all out ASAP. We will not be safe and you will see what a great mistake you have made.

"6/30/2020 9:04:32 AM",-19,"","","To the Minneapolis Charter Commission, As a resident of North Minneapolis, invested in my community as a coach at Harrison Park, business owner with my primary location in Minneapolis, and having read the full text of the proposed amendment to our City Charter, I am pleading with you not to move forward with the Council’s amendment to the City Charter that would allow for the removal of the Police Department in Minneapolis.  Personally, I am not opposed to reforming, or even rethinking, safety and law enforcement in our community. As a Native American, I have experienced my share of inequalities in various forms, including some of my past interactions with law enforcement officers. Change is due. I am convinced of this. Having said that, I am also convinced that our City Council members have forgotten that they represent the people of this City. They have forged ahead with this proposed amendment to the City Charter with little to no input from their constituents, and with no regard for how their public comments have affected the rest of us. Our police department needs change, but the speed at which our Council has moved, their lack of an earnest attempt at gaining community feedback, as well as their apparent lack of regard for accountability of their actions is irresponsible, inconsiderate, and arrogant. On the day that George Floyd was killed by police officers in South Minneapolis, I was having a different experience with officers in North Minneapolis. I would encourage each of you to watch this 4 minute video (https://www.dropbox.com/s/2f36bbe2zf1yuxk/memorial_day_2020_RIP-GF.mp4?dl=0) taken from my security cameras on Monday, May 25 at 14:33. Don’t be fooled by the seeming peacefulness of our lilacs in bloom or the group of bicyclers passing in the first few frames. Very shortly a group of young men will walk by. One will continue on to a duplex only 3 doors down from where I am with my 7 children in my backyard. After spending a few minutes in the duplex, the young man comes off of the porch backwards and pulls a gun from his pants and proceeds to let off at least 10 shots into the duplex. You’ll see his friends scatter at the sound of the gunshots. He also turns and runs. All of these young men run for at least one reason, none of them wants to be the recipient of one of the gunshots. But there’s a second reason they all run. They know that it won’t be long before the police arrive, and if they are still onsite when they do, they will very likely go to jail. They don’t want that. This restraint that comes from a knowledge of consequences is a blessing. Councilman Ellison is fond of pointing out that our current department is still funded and failing us (https://twitter.com/jeremiah4north/status/1275596596110151680). Despite proactive measures they may take, the police are obviously not be able to prevent the initial act of most crimes, but the simple knowledge that they exist and will be on the way shortly goes a long way in restraining the measure of violence that most individuals are willing to commit simply due to time constraints. And the past month, with it’s 100+ shootings and accompanying murders — most after the Council’s reckless public statements — prove that when people, already bent on committing violence, even conceptually perceive that there may be a reduction in the consequences for their lawless acts, they commit their lawless acts with virtually no restraint.  Take the recent incident at Jordan Park as an example (https://kstp.com/minnesota-news/boys-football-team-runs-for-safety-after-gunfire-erupts-near-minneapolis-practice-field/5769811/). Listen to this mother (https://kstp.com/minnesota-news/boys-football-team-runs-for-safety-after-gunfire-erupts-near-minneapolis-practice-field/5769811/) describe the seeming unending nature of the shootout as the perpetrators circled the block multiple times to continue their violence, all while 50+ kids were trying to dodge bullets and the adults in the park"

Or at least one more year of  Social training. I do not like that they're acting like the police murdered the man in Minneapolis. Maybe manslaughter maybe accidental killing but it was not murder and I'm tired of fear and I'm calling it murdered him. Look up the words they're using. The man was cashing fake money and had already been in trouble in the store before that's why they called the police. He also fought with the police officers putting himself on the ground basically. He also apparently had a her condition and the people leaning on his back were just as dangerous as the one leaning on his neck. There is no crew that leaning against his neck killed him. Will you have not seen all the body camera footage and all of the recorded footage he fought getting in the car they had to restrain him somehow he was a very large man and he also possibly was drinking. The coroner said he had a heart condition as well. The so I would not have put any police officers in jail for this may need to let it all come out in court I think they will be not convicted of murder. I probably would not even convict them of a lesser crime simply because they were doing their job. Yes one of them have had some past problems and IX remember him. I have lived in meeting up was for more than 30 years. Minneapolis is the least racist state almost in our country. If America is racist we would not have elected Barack Obama to president twice they even voted for him in swing States. So I hope this guy's now the protests were big because nobody's working and there's that certain element that just wants to raise hell no matter what.

To put it into perspective, I am liberal and voted for Bernie. However, I could not disagree more with the way the city council is handling this issue. Our city government has failed us this summer. Shootings have skyrocketed since calls for the abolition if the police. I am the head of maintenance for a 223 unit apartment complex. We work our butts off 40 hours a week to maintain affordable and safe homes for over 350 Minneapolitans. What you have done is put our residents (of many colors, genders, and nationalities) in danger. Does the city provide housing? No, you make laws that tell us how we need to provide it for you. Yet you won't protect the very people that live in this city. I feel the city council is not representing all of its constituents, only a (very) vocal minority. We will see when you put this on the ballot. Could you write into the referendum that if the citizens of Minneapolis choose to keep the police, that everyone on the city council will leave their seats? We do need serious reform and accountibility from those who are sworn to serve and protect us. And from those we elect. If you would like to actually address the problems we have, and not just get a sound bite in the paper, I have many real and lasting solutions that would make the city a better and safer place to live for all but especially low income residents and people of color. Your proposals have not even begun to address the basic needs of the people of this city. And don't even get me started on Powderhorn park. Those sexual assaults are YOUR fault. You've had years now to work on that issue and have done literally nothing. Is it complex, yes of course. But is your solution to homelessness seriously to have them camp in the park? How inhumane. You should try living there for a week. We COULD house every homeless person in this city, but that's work not talk. If you want to make actual progress and be leaders, feel free to talk to me, I feel that I really have some great ideas. I know this is somewhat of a rant, but it's been a long summer already here and I am angry. I want to be part of the solution, but you have not proposed a solution, just an elimination.

"6/30/2020 9:11:17 AM",-11,"","","After reading the proposed amendments to the Minneapolis city charter I am of the opinion that the Minneapolis city council is putting the cart before the horse. You are endeavoring to change a legal document with only a vague idea of what you plan to do with law enforcement. This is dangerous, as it will give you authority to make changes you haven't made clear to the public. Changes you can't make clear to the public because you do not yet know what that are. This strikes me as irresponsible and more than a little dishonest. You have fearful sections of the population who are buying your vague plan because they in turn fear the police. This guarantees their vote without them being truly informed. That's the dishonest part.Others fear abolishment because of the recent rash of violence that has sprung up in Minneapolis' new ""wild west"". If you want my opinion, this move looks like an election day ploy. My suggestion is you present the public with some real data and models before presenting them with a ballot that they don't understand. Please don't take my resistance to your proposal as support for past behaviors of the MPD. I'm neither red nor blue. I am a pragmatist. That is my political stance. Until you can present an actual working model of your new law enforcement, rather than generic terms describing your utopian pipe dream, I will not vote for charter reform and will do what I can to dissuade others from voting in favor."
"6/30/2020 9:12:05 AM",-3,"","","Though I don't live within the city limits of Minneapolis, I do live in Columbia Heights, 4 blocks outside the Minneapolis boundary.  What Minneapolis does with their police will have an effect on Columbia Heights, due to the close proximity. I believe it is a mistake to disband the police department.  The Minneapolis Department and surrounding communities often work together when situations require that cooperation.  Having a centralized department with trained officers and communications that are connected statewide for emergencies is important. Right now, Minneapolis is experiencing a dangerous spike in shootings, giving Minneapolis the nickname ""Murderopolis"" around the rest of the United States.  Disbanding the police department now is the exact opposite of what you should be doing.  Instead, train officers, make changes within the department to better address community needs, but don't throw out the baby with the bath water.   If I were an MPD officer right now, I would be looking for another job.  These people put their lives on the line, and policing is their career.  When their jobs are threatened, both due to lack of backing from city officials and the threat of restructuring, there is little reason for the best to stick around. You are making a serious mistake, one that it will be difficult to recover from in the future when you finally see that and decide to rebuild the police department.  It may well be difficult to attract qualified candidates for those jobs at that time, given what has been happening to the departmet. Thanks for reading"

"6/30/2020 9:12:12 AM",-3,"","","I am strongly in favor of establishing a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department. I believe the current MPD has a deeply rooted culture of racism and protecting officers who use excessive and/or deadly force. This is enabled by the current union leadership. We need more preventative programs and types of emergency resources like social workers and mental health professions to work for a safer Minneapolis."
"6/30/2020 9:12:23 AM",-20,"","","I like the idea of replacing the Police Department with a Department of Public safety. We don't need police officers responding to things like broken tail-lights, people being drunk in public, most mental health problems, etc. Police officers generally don't have the skill set to handle many of these situations, and just their presence can escalate things.  I also do believe that we need a law enforcement arm of the department, as the charter lists, for things like armed conflicts, hostage situations, violent crimes, etc, as it would be unfair to send public service workers and socials workers to these situations where they are unlikely to accomplish much and could be seriously injured or killed.  One thing that is important to me with this development is whether or not the police union would retain any oversight over the police officers in the law enforcement arm of the department. The union has gone to great lengths to protect police with a history of excessive violence and has created a culture where police are not held accountable for their actions. This in turn has increased excessive violence by the police, particularly towards members of the black community. I think the police union needs to be removed from this situation so that officers who are excessively violent or racist can be held accountable. I think by doing this we can help restore faith in the policing system and also weed out bad cops so that eventually (if trust can be established) people of all backgrounds and races can feel safe in calling upon them for assistance. Unfortunately a lot of the members of the community feel like the police are more likely to harm them than help them and that has to change.  In short I think having the majority of issues handled by people who are more specialized in dealing with them, and who do not bring a threat of violence will go a long way to reduce harm towards members of the community."

Property values will plummet.  More violent gangs will move in, without law and order.    As more empty buildings are created, more violence will ensue.   It's a roller coaster. Without businesses, restaurants and retail, where will your tax dollars come from to run the city and/or fund the police department.   Soon Mpls/St Paul will be come Chicago.  A place with such a high crime and murder rate, no one will want to visit.  I certainly won't attend a Twins, Vikings, Timberwolves or Wild game.  I won't attend the theatre.

While I agree there needs to be substantive change in the way the police department operates specifically with regards to disciplining/firing officers, this should be coupled with more resources for enough officers to do the community policing and other engagement with the public that will be needed to build back trust. This is incredibly important because if we are going to stem the tide of gang violence and crime in this city we will need a majority of our citizens to trust the police and have a police system that will both preemptively engage to stop crime as well as quickly respond when it's reported happening. In addition, those advocating ""defund"" or ""abolishment"" or whatever the new phrase have close to no details except mental health workers showing up for mental health crisis. I say great let's do it, but if you think this coupled with more jobs programs will deter all crime I think you are misunderstanding human nature. We will always have a segment of the population who does not follow or care about its laws and will need to be taken care of for the benefit of the rest of us in society. The details on this is what we decide in our legislative chambers and ballot box, not by fiat from this council. While I could say more, I'll summarize with this: if you don't have details on EXACTLY what this new ""Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department"" would look like then you will get a clear vote of NO from me and I will actively petition others to do the same."

If you actually have a plan, then explain what the response will be to future crime--how will crimes be investigated?  If you think there will no longer be crime, then you're in fantasy land.  There was already slow and inadequate 911 response-this council launched a year-long investigation into just that issue.  Not one council member has explained specifically how the rising crime would be lessened by defunding the police.  Obviously this police force is in need of massive reform, which you could have addressed sooner, by the way.  Now you want to replace the police department after an online commentary, no plan, and a quick vote.  This is irresponsible and careless.  The New Jersey example is not a good comparison as a much smaller town.  Share your actual plan by outlining what we can expect for public safety when you have shoved this down our throats.  Then at least we can decide whether or not to move before our home values disappear through the ground.  It is profoundly unhelpful that the council president states that it is privileged to be able to call 911, privileged to  expect a response to garage break-ins.  Every single resident of Mpls should feel confident calling 911 and reporting theft.  Clean up the existing department!  Also--the hypocrisy evident in taxpayers paying for paid security  for council members who want to deny our ability to expect the same is staggering.   As a homeowner I know my voice is not valued by the city, but it should be remembered that we pay high taxes and played our part in making this city the beautiful place it is/was."

Reforms are obviously necessary and reprioritization of funding can be addressed as well... but this “defund the police” campaign is politicized pandering to a few. Tax payers and tax paying businesses want to know that they are safe to do business and carry out day to day activities and a social worker or psychiatrist cannot make it so.  I believe three of you city council members are aware that services such as those offered by the police are absolutely necessary, as you have your own private security protecting you now. It is confusing that all citizens of Minneapolis should be ok with getting a social worker or therapist when they feel unsafe but City council members get personal security details courtesy of the tax payers.

I fear the police, and I’m a middle-aged white woman who has never been arrested and is/has always been completely drug free. I’ve seen the inequities in our neighborhoods. Inequities and low-access to services heighten “crime”, mostly out of necessity, sometimes out of rage. Our current police force are operating on treating the symptom. We need to treat the disease. We do that with better funded social programs, better jobs, affordable housing, de-escalation of domestic disputes, and social work resources. These are the skills that our under-educated police force should be learning. We also need personality test screens.

The claim that a police officer 'feared for their life' is a crutch; if we let firefighters claim the same, our city would burn down.  The proposed department name change, ""department of community safety and violence prevention,"" is an important step as it refocuses the core mission of this new department.

"6/30/2020 9:20:58 AM",0,"","","I truly believe this charter amendment is the only way forward for us as a city. Even if we do nothing more than disband the current police department and rebuild it with different folks, different leadership, a different accountability structure, and a functional internal culture, it will be a vast improvement. But I think there's a lot of potential here to redefine the role of police in our city in a way that will actually serve all of us better, rather than using police as a one-size-fits-all solution to every issue. (I am not supportive of abolishing the police altogether, and I don't think most people are; I don't believe this amendment will result in anything that drastic.) I live three blocks from the epicenter of the third precinct protests/riots. I cannot capture in words just how stressful and destabilizing living through this has been (and I have resources that many of my neighbors do not). I would not wish this on anyone   - and yet, if the MPD manages to murder yet another citizen, I can't see how this WON'T happen again, somewhere in the city to some other neighborhood. It's imperative that we TRULY SOLVE THIS ISSUE NOW.  It's time to break out every tool in the toolbox.  I strongly encourage you to allow this charter amendment to be put before voters, so that we may decide on our own fate for ourselves."

Adding trained professionals in the Mental Health field as another resource to aid ""policing"" policies and procedures could go a long way to inspire safety within oneself and the community at large.  Additionally, adding members from communities to be a part of the policing efforts humanizes community safety measures.  Adding members representative of people living in the community could add another layer of information to helping keep everyone safe.  Status quo needs to change with a focus on changing the current culture of police forces.  Small steps could go a long way to create these changes.  Best of success to all of you as all of us need you help us help each other to create a sense of safety within all communities in our city."

Just them mentioning it and people think its a free for all on crime especially in North Minneapolis. This is such a short amount of time to have a good thought out plan. I want big changes but this is not the way to do it. In north Minneapolis where I live, I already thought there was not enough police. you cant get them to show up and do anything when its not life or death. Had someone try to break into my house and it took them 30 min just to come and do a drive by. This is terrible policing. The police need more resources and more specialized training and more thorough vetting process but not what the city council is discussing in such short term. Start by having police officers that look the neighborhoods they are working in and forming some better trust. The police department have no accountability now but we need them and the city leaders need to do a better job of holding them accountable."

I agree that change does need to happen, however completely removing the police department is not the answer.  If this does pass, we will be moving from Minneapolis.

"6/30/2020 9:23:13 AM",-13,"","","Yes, the police department needs to change, reform, remove the violent cronyism but not be disbanded. In all the new PC names for the group, there is one word missing...Protection.  You can soften the connotation of the department name by calling them safety or peace officers, but that is simply semantics at it’s  worst. There needs to be new leadership, trained to use the methods developed by Newark New Jersey to serve rather than enforce. This does not allow for totally dismantling the department but bringing in new leadership, training and community resources.  I want the police to aid citizens when help is needed and there are still is a huge criminal element to deal with which needs police officers (and not merely social workers) as deterrents and crime solvers.  I want to be protected. I want criminals stopped and dealt with in a process, not just a showing of guns. Also not simply slaps on the hand and counseled to do better.  The entire system needs to examined from family education on parenting and values to education, job preparation, etc.  Progressive City Council members can NOT solve the issues of this city by merely placing all the blame on the police. Do your real job of helping the community to prosper and not setting us all up for failure.  Note that in cities where the police pulled back as protesters screamed for, crime quickly increased. We can’t take a utopian point of view that if the police are dismantled we will all be happy and peaceful, but truly analyze what has worked and what has exacerbated crime. This has to be looked at rationally and not emotionally as I see the City Council doing now."
"6/30/2020 9:23:27 AM",1,"","","Apologies for a second feedback form.  To expand on what I suggested in my first form as to “create the plan before asking citizens to vote”, here is what I mean. I think it would help citizens decide if they can get on board.  —Identify the categories of calls officers respond to now. I.e., domestic abuse, drunken and disorderly, etc.  —Identify/propose who would respond to each of those categories, what their experience and training will be.  —At least one category should be responding to violent crime. That should be addressed by an armed police force. If not MPD, propose solutions like Hennepin Cty Sheriff’s office —All respondents should have “de-escalation” training.  Make sure there is clear reporting and accountability. We need a fairly consolidated reporting structure.  Thanks for accepting my feedback."

I am terrified for the business owners in Minneapolis.  This amendment leaves too many questions unanswered and has the potential to allow the Minneapolis City Council to do whatever they want in the future. Have any of these City Council members spent extensive time shadowing police? Have they seen what officers encounter on a day to day basis? Have they asked social workers if they would feel comfortable responding, alone, to the many instances this City Council feels are appropriate?  I do not want someone overseeing my children’s education that has no experience in day to day classroom teaching. Just as I also don’t want someone overseeing a Police Department that has no experience in law enforcement. The vast majority of officers are good. They do good work, they engage with the community, they protect and they serve day in and day out. They take an oath to do this.  We have seen crime rates spike in recent weeks when people feel they are entitled to commit crimes. When they feel that police may be taking a back seat. This is not the answer.

I thoroughly support the goals of the city to redefine our system of public safety to equitably protect all of our citizens, promote de-escalation of violence, and provide the appropriate resources when responding to a crisis.  Unfortunately, this amendment doesn't accomplish any of those goals, nor does it even require the City Council to put in place a plan that accomplishes any of those goals.  Rather it gives the City Council a blank check to do whatever it sees fit, whenever it sees fit, and offers no system of accountability for them, or for any other official or department that may be providing public safety services.  The Council appears to be interested in grabbing quick headlines and more power along the way, rather than engaging in the tough conversations with all parts of our community required to develop a fair and thoughtful public safety system that provides racial equity.  I urge you to force the Council to do its job, engage in the hard work required to put develop a Plan that actually will create equity and hold people accountable to that objective, and then put that proposal before the voters, because only then can we make meaningful progress on the grievous disparities we currently have."

The City Council has done no research and has no ideas or proposals as to what this new system would look like. It allows for only 6 montsh  before going into effect, meaning an entirely new system of safetey and crime prevention will need to be invented and implemented from scratch in less than a year. This is an incomplete proposal that puts the community at risk. Other cities (Rockford, IL, Camden NJ) have put in place community based policing efforts which take years to design and roll out. By rushing to implement this ""band aid"" the city council is putting lives at stake.

With the shootings spiraling out of control and mutual aid networks stretched to their breaking point, this discussion feels like it needs to be couched within this context. I'm really confused why all the public meetings I'm seeing are about each individual issue and not the complex as a whole. I support change, I support the movement but this seems like more of a knee jerk reaction than a plan. Give me a plan.  Also, the city is doing a shit job of informing citizens about what'shappenning on the street right now.

Once July hits and covid unemployment checks stop and mutual aid dries up in the heat of summer even more this cluster will explode.  How do you vote on this issue with what's going on right now without a plan? This is not safe, what's the bridge between the present and the future?

The calls coming into the 911/department would be routed to the specialty support teams that would provide onsite intervention. Their job would involve follow up; possibly referral to further services provided in the community ongoing. These teams would interface with regularity maybe share space and have regular sessions of support ; problem solve etc .. Most importantly these job positions would require training and be well compensated given the nature of the important delicate work/hours. And to attract those that are highly skilled individuals.  The individuals race and gender should reflect that of the community they are serving . Scholarship training given to those who display superior skills but lack funds /training.

You have to remember we live in a country where guns abound and we saw just last week, drive by shootings can happen anywhere, including the center of Uptown where we go to watch movies and eat--not anymore! When the community is in charge of safety, more panic ensues--see attached from my neighbors who now feel like they have to watch out for our South Minneapolis neighborhood. Police have responded to our alarm going off within less than a minute the 27 years we have lived in the city and this makes us feel safe, particularly when alone due to my husband's travels. More training, background checks, etc are needed instead of replacing the police. Such a decision will impact many of us and we decided we will be moving out of Minneapolis even though we love our city and do not mind paying the high taxes it takes to live here. And, remember that as a city and state we have trouble attracting talent. Who would be moving to Minneapolis when they do not feel safe? I have worked with the police dept as a professor at the U, in particular the sex trafficking unit, and have always valued their commitment and hard work when underfunded and understaffed. We need to support the police and find ways to strengthen their work and community engagement rather than rely on the community for public safety. Where in the world is there a place that relies on community for policing? And do not mention Scandinavian countries again--no guns,  more homogeneous societies, a sense of collective thinking. Would be happy to talk more but given all that is going on and the anguish many of us feel, Minneapolis residents deserve a much more thought-out plan to look over rather than what is presented."

I believe the City Council is being reactive and short sighted. While I like the ADDITION of a Safety and Violence Prevention Department it should be separate from but work in conjunction with the Police Department. I don't believe a small enforcement division within the Safety prevention department should replace the current police department. I also feel removing the Police Department from the city charter will have an enormous economic impact to the city. National conferences, sporting events, companies will look at that when considering to do business in Minneapolis, and I feel they will choose not to. Reform is needed, no doubt, like the removal of the police union, particularly the  head of the union Bob Kroll, but abolishing the police department is not the answer. I also believe all of this is being too rushed just to make the November ballot. If this is truly something the City Council wants to consider they need to take their time and actually have public hearings to listen to their constituents before pushing through a reactive agenda.

"6/30/2020 9:32:31 AM",-25,"","","Defunding / dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department is a terrible idea.  There is absolutely ZERO benefit to the people and businesses of Minneapolis and the neighboring cities to remove the MPD.  Since the riots have happened there are multiple businesses who have stated they will be relocating to a new city because they don’t feel the Mayor and City Council will protect their businesses when needed.  Additional businesses will continue to do so if your council moves forward with dismantling / defunding the police and the City of Minneapolis will suffer by losing tax revenue.  The defunding / dismantling of the MPD will lead to more and more crime, which Minneapolis has already seen over the past month.  Over 100 people have been shot in Minneapolis alone since Memorial Day weekend and that is not solely because we’re getting into summer.  The Mayor and City Council have lost control and criminals know it.  Criminals will continue to take advantage of innocent people because the police force has had their hands tied behind their back. If you move forward with dismantling / defunding the MPD I will put every vote I have against all active members of the Minneapolis City Council.  You have become the laughingstock of the United States.  The fact you’re calling for dismantling / defunding the MPD yet have spending $63,000 on private security proves that you’re scared of the violent crime that is now happening in Minneapolis under your watch."

Reform can truly come from inside the MPD, primarily because command staff in charge at this time, including Chief Rondo, is the entity that can affect change through changing policy.  Those officers who don't want to comply with new policy can find another job with another department or retire early.  The vast majority of MPD officers are good cops and should be retained.  They still have to ensure public safety, which is exactly what we need right now.  I've been a prosecutor for the city of Minneapolis for 22 years and I've been a Minneapolis resident almost as long.  I don't want to remain a resident of a city who does not have a police department.  We're moivng out of the city if the MPD is defunded and a new ""community policing"" model is adopted.

I am a north side teacher as well. I have worked very hard trying to combat gang activity in my school and with my students. There are so many agencies involved and people long before things get bad- but we STILL need police. This is reckless and I find it disturbing that most of you likely have no clue.

How easy to say when you are not here Day in and day out as I have been for years. You as a council are not getting info, not connecting with community and not doing anything of note. This survey is also very easy to lie on.

Perhaps your goal is (which it appears it may be) for those who have worked their entire lives to be forced to vacate their homes so you can give them to those who refuse to do anything but complain, riot and never work -- if so...again, you will be ruining the entire city and running it to the ground and will have no taxes coming in, etc to pay for anything.

"6/30/2020 9:38:38 AM",33,"","","I appreciate the efforts the City Council has undertaken to reform the Minneapolis Police Department to create something better out of a system that is very broken.  After reading the proposed Amendment altering the City Charter however, I have some key areas of concern.  In my opinion, this Amendment does not address the root of the problems or create an environment for a successful outcome if this Amendment passes. I think one of the most important things we need to address is a specific Charter Provision that outlines that police officers should be hired from within the City of Minneapolis and more specifically within the precincts that they will be employed in.  I think this is a very important part of creating a successful community-oriented police department.  This is also a popular idea across the political spectrum that increases the likelihood of an Amendment such as this passing.  This should also be specifically defined in the Charter, emphasizing the commitment to a community led police department.   Another concern I have is removing the language that identifies the quantity of police officers that Minneapolis is required to have and the sources of revenue that are to be allocated by the City Council to fund a police department.  I think these are both important areas that need to be identified explicitly in this Amendment, and I think that leaving these details out is problematic. This effort should be completely transparent, and all aspects should be able to be scrutinized by the citizens of Minneapolis.  I think we have a right to know exactly how many police officers Minneapolis should be expected to have at a minimum, and how much of our property tax money is expected to fund such a department.  Removing this language hampers a robust debate on what we as a community can expect out of a reinvented police department.  Without a proposed number of officers, or a proposal for a maximum property tax levy to fund this change, the Amendment grants the City Council too much unchecked power and a blank check to create and fund a new department.  I think there needs to be a provision where this power is checked, and I think that including language for a minimum police department size, and a maximum funding amount is necessary to make this a successful amendment. My final major concern is semantics.  Renaming the “Police Department” to the “Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention” is an empty symbolic gesture.  If we really want to address the underlying issues that the City of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department are facing, we need to dig deeper than the name of what we call the police and work to fundamentally change what a police department looks like, and how they are expected to behave in a more community aligned style of policing.   As written, the proposed Amendment does not address hiring police from within the community they are hired to serve, or what a police force looks like in terms of number of officers, or how this police force is specifically funded.  The Amendment merely changes what we call the police, removes the Mayor’s oversite of the department, and removes the confines and definitions that the City Council needs to operate within to provide a police department to Minneapolitans; eliminating accountability.   These are major concerns that are not addressed by this Amendment, and in a fair and transparent process, the citizens of Minneapolis deserve to know in more substantive detail how we are planning to fundamentally alter our police department.  These details begin with the City Charter Amendment, and I think a more detailed Amendment proposal that expressly addresses these concerns is required.  Without these details, citizens do not have the tools for a constructive debate, and this does not provide the best foundation for an open and informed community led effort to reform the Minneapolis Police Department. Thank you for taking the time to review my concern."

"6/30/2020 9:45:42 AM",18,"","","see attachment – Barry Clegg and Members of the Charter Commission -  While reform of the Minneapolis Police is essential and urgent, I think it is not so urgent that we should rush through an ill-conceived and muddled charter change.  If we don’t have time to do it right the first time, how can we possibly afford a second try.  The current timeline does to allow for significant consultation with the community nor does it allow for education of voters and the development of understanding.  I am opposed to the Minneapolis City Council action to amend the Minneapolis City Charter.  My reasons are similar to those noted by others, including the signers of a recent Op-Ed piece in the Strib. To wit the proposed charter change: 1.  Would eliminate the police department without substitution.  Right now the Council does not have a plan.  It    only promises to develop the plan and implementation strategies in the future.  When, how, with or without community input, with or without examination of successful strategies used in other communities.   2.  Would demolish clear lines of accountability.  It eliminates the authority of the Mayor and places control in the hands of the council.  When there are so many bosses, there is no one in charge. 3.  Doesn’t ensure that there would be actually be a police function within the city.  It gives no indication of how this function could be fulfilled. While in the long run charter change may indeed be needed and should not hamstring the city in making necessary changes in the future, I do not believe the current language provides adequate assurances that this would happen.  I hope the Charter Commission will exercise its responsibility to make sure that the timing and language of any proposed charter change related to policing is clear, flexible and forward-looking.  The council can do much to transform the policing function in Minneapolis, improve public safety, address racial inequalities and remove social and policy barriers without the proposed charter change.

Having the police respond to the variety of calls that get made to 911 is like treating everything like a nail by providing a hammer. Sometimes what is needed is a mental health counselor, a temporary place to stay, an abuser to be removed from a home. These things cannot be provided by a police response.

At the end of the day, you are responsible for your choices.  I think every system has room for improvement, and no system or program is ever perfect.  That’s the point, isn’t it? To always have the chance to change or work to be better? But to get rid of a program just because of a few bad apples in the department is ignorant and simply the wrong choice.  Minneapolis will be worst for it and crime will not magically disappear.  Humanity is capable of anything, looting, rioting, and distorting their own communities? In the name of racial injustice? I hope it was worth it because I simply don’t understand how homeowners & businesses will want to come back to a city that left them to the wolves.  And if there is no police, do we hire private security? How can the average American, no matter the color of their skin, afford that when they don’t have the taxpayer to pay for it? If another “community led program” is in charge of keeping the area safe, how do you know the treatment will be fair and not unjust? A police officer made an oath to protect the city, when they break it, they are punished accordingly.  Who will be policing those who are supposedly going to keep us safe? Is it going to be the city?

"6/30/2020 9:46:58 AM",-10,"","","I do not support the decision to remove the police and replace it with whatever the city council has in mind and here's why: 1. Mpls city council is inept. They failed to keep our neighborhood safe (Longfellow) and cheered on rioters who burned down our local businesses and terrorized our streets for a week. This demonstrates not only their ineptitude in leadership, it's proof that they simply do not care to keep its citizens safe. Our business owners had to sleep in their businesses to keep watch over them and ensure they were safe from looting and burning. They did not receive tax funded private security even though they suffered actual threats of violence which were carried out on other businesses, (see Town Talk Diner, Ghandi Mahal, El Nuevo Rodeo, Minnehaha Liquor. Cadillac Pawn, etc. all of which do not exist anymore as they were burned to the ground. Oh, and we no longer have a post office.) You can't blame the police for this because the city council and mayor instructed them to stand down.    2. Double Standards: three council members have used our tax dollars for their own private protection. So while we'll get basically no protection (except what we do for ourselves) they will plunder the coffers to keep themselves safe, (and we’ve yet to see proof of these so-called death threats, btw). They do not seem to understand the basic concept that they work for us, they are employed by us, therefore they serve us. They care about their own safety, but not ours as evidenced this past month.  3. It’s political posturing. Having grown up in the DC area (not very far from where Mayor Frey grew up,) in and around politics and politicians, I've come to recognize when they are “having their moment” and that’s Minneapolis right now. I don’t think our city council cares about resolving any issues (since they’re not good at it and this group never has been,) as much as they care about the spotlight they’re in right now. They want the attention. The more “radical” they seem, the more they pander to the fringe, the more national attention they get.  There are corrupt police officers, and that should be investigated. There should be reform and harsher penalties for offenders who are there to serve and protect. They should be fired after the first incident of corruption of any kind. But I do not trust our inept city council to come up with anything close to being effective in keeping us safe. They’ve proven that they won’t. They’ve proven that they don’t care. They put their own self-interests first. They feel they are above the rest of us.  All someone has to do to see how the city council would keep us safe is take a look at what's left of the Minnehaha/Lake corridor. The rubble that remains there sums it up perfectly."
"6/30/2020 9:47:02 AM",8,"","","I do not support the proposed charter language and encourage you to vote to not approve the amendment for the following reasons: 1. I do not support the striking of the police department and replacing with a department of community safety and violence prevention.   2. I am NOT in favor of ""b) division of law enforcement services"" which states the ""Council MAY maintain a division of law enforcement services"" when it should say ""WILL maintain a division of law enforcement services"".  A city of this size must have a law enforcement department. 3. There are not enough details in the proposed amendment that adequately address the day to day workings of this proposed new department, especially compared to the striken language and the remaining fire department language. 4. Why is not the fire department a part of the community safety department? Most jurisdictions that have a public safety department do so for cost savings to combine law enforcement and fire. I, too, want reform and I want changes in how the police department functions, how officers are disciplined, and funding levels spent.  I want to see specifics about how any new system will work before I can consider myself informed enough to support any reform.  I want the opportunity to provide comments on proposed changes.  The timeline of this amendment and rush to get onto the November ballot does not afford this opportunity.  Please consider not approving. Thank you for your service on this Commission."
"6/30/2020 9:47:53 AM",-37,"","","I am a mental health provider who has worked with people in every point of the judicial system. My significant experience providing mental health services to both victims and perpetrators of crime has also involved collaboration with various law enforcement entities. After reviewing many proposals, such as MPD 150, including the city council's proposal, I strongly disagree with abolishing the police.   First, none of the proposals include actions steps or details on what would replace the police, functions, etc. Frustratingly, the proposals fail to acknowledge reality of the current environment (e.g., mental health services are limited, providers are underpaid, safety is a problem/ongoing issue). These proposals assume crime occurs purely out of necessity, which if criminology research was referenced one would know that is not entirely accurate.   Many of the people identified to respond in lieu of the police, like mental health providers, were clearly not consulted about their proposed role. The majority of mental health providers are not trained to provide crisis services, do not have the resources to safely provide crisis services without police support, and the various core issues in the proposals (i.e., crimes, mental illness, homelessness, prostitution, sexual assault, etc.) require a safe, stable environment to address the problem behavior, when it is not currently occurring.  Additionally, the city council's proposed amendment fails to prioritize the community's safety by putting someone in charge who does not understand nor have experience with law enforcement, by not identifying supervising entities, clear parameters of what is needed, and overall lacks essential details and understanding of how both law enforcement and various community services actually work. One person should not be solely in charge and that individual would not be able to effectively perform their job due to having too many competing demands. Rather than eliminating the system, it requires intense review to ensure the right people are placed in positions of power. Significant changes need to occur within the police department and the Minneapolis police department should be held to a higher standard, but refusing to fund a data driven system that would utilize data/facts to create change (i.e., which is important because it would eliminate emotions/biases) is a problem, as this would produce unbiased information which could have produced effective change.   Furthermore, eliminating the police would further worsen the economy (i.e., businesses would move their businesses out of town). These proposals are short-sighted and fail to appreciate the ripple effects of actions/decisions. By creating a further economic problems, crime would undoubtedly increase and cause significant consequences. I work with underserved clients because I want to create change, but my ability to do my job is limited as there is not enough funding for security staff (placing me in imminently dangerous situations), but it is shocking and appalling that city council members would continue to push to eliminate my safety/protection (i.e., police), while they use taxpayer money to fund their own private protection. Therefore, I do not support the police being abolished. The communities are traumatized and by eliminating the police, further trauma and problems will be created. Whatever plan is implemented, it should involve changing law enforcement, holding everyone to a higher standard, be detailed and involve content experts, work from reality (not ideals), be factual/statistical/research driven, incorporate restorative measures for police/community/and between both groups, hold law enforcement to a higher standard, fund necessary services (mental health), ensure necessary training is regularly provided, be fairly applied to all (i.e., no public funding for private security), the solution comes from working together and the solution shouldn't be worse than the problem."

"6/30/2020 9:48:16 AM",2,"","","I support the amendment to remove the police department and establish a Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department. I believe this will make our city safer for all."
"6/30/2020 9:48:20 AM",-13,"","","Hello.  My name is 000000000e, I have been a resident of Minneapolis since I bought my home in January 2014.  I grew up across the river in Saint Paul and have been born and raised in the Twin Cities.  I love the Twin Cities.  I am writing to urge the city - Charter Commission; City Council; Mayor; anyone else in a position of authority - to not take any further action supporting the abolishment or disbandment of the Minneapolis Police Department.  I urge the Charter Commission to reject the initiative to amend the City Charter to remove the Police Department.      When I was 24 years old and was looking for a house to buy, and a place to establish myself, I was very excited when a property became available in South Minneapolis.  Were I in the same position today, I would probably not purchase a home in Minneapolis knowing that there is a serious possibility of the city removing the police department.  The city and the powers that be in the city need to reflect in earnest on what our city would look like without a police force.  The City of Minneapolis will be far worse off without the Minneapolis Police Department.  The unfortunate fact is that there will always be people in the city looking to commit crime.  The citizens of Minneapolis need a robust, fully funded, well trained professional police department to check the threats and problems from criminal activity.  Removing the police department will not remove these problems in our society, if anything, these problems will likely become exasperated with police removed from the equation.  Throughout human history where ever people have lived together there has always been an apparatus for dealing with criminal activity, or behavior against the norms of society.  All functioning societies have had mechanisms for dealing with those who break the law.  The City has acted ignorant of thousands of years of recorded human history in thinking that the City can somehow create a new way of public safety that transcends the basic need of law enforcement.  Thankfully in the 21st century there are now more humane ways of enforcing the law than some ways of the past.  I do also fully acknowledge that there are problems with the Minneapolis Police Department.  The presence of problems does not justify removing the police department all together.  The department needs to be reformed, not removed.  By turning away from the police we will be turning towards a system where lawlessness, crime, and anarchy are much more apt to thrive.  That is a world that I believe is in not in anyone's interest for the future of the City of Minneapolis.  I do support structural change to the existing Minneapolis Police Department to provide for better trained officers.  I do not support the city moving to remove the requirement for our city to have police.  I fully understand that I am only one voter, one voice.  I feel it my responsibility to reach out and voice that it is inappropriate and a total disservice to the citizens of Minneapolis to potentially remove the requirement for the City to have a police department.   What I want to let the city know is that I will be voting no for any amendment to the city charter removing the requirement for police.  If the city were to successfully pass this amendment, I will unfortunately likely be moving out of the the City of Minneapolis as well due to the lack of police in the city to maintain law and order. I therefore urge all in positions of power in the City to take action to reform and fully fund the City of Minneapolis Police Department, and to stop wasting time and tax payer money over talk of abolishing the police.  It is truly a disservice to all."
"6/30/2020 9:48:24 AM",5,"","","While I agree that a radical transition is required within the police force, I disagree that a rebranding of it would accomplish anything other than a 10 second national news clip to be used solely for political grandstanding and reelection. In fact, I would say it is avoiding the issue by shifting the narrative away from systemic racial injustice and onto an ""Us versus them"". A rose by any other name after all, is still a rose.  The remit of the police force is to Protect & Serve, I would suggest our counsel spend its time and money helping to figure out a way to do just that in a manner respectful to all citizens, including our black neighbors, as their lives matter as well."
"6/30/2020 9:48:40 AM",0,"","","I reach out to you today as a very concerned citizen - and home owner - from Northeast Minneapolis. Like the entire city, I am shocked, angered, and appalled at the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police department; however, I firmly believe the actions of a minority do not warrant disbanding of the entire Minneapolis police department. Last week's city council vote worries me. Their vote to disband the police was a knee jerk reaction to a very vocal minority - or perhaps plurality - or citizens, without having a concrete plan as to what the next steps look like. This “ready, fire, aim” approach rarely works - and I’m afraid public safety will one of casualties. Rather than putting a city charter amendment on the November 2020 ballot, I would like to see a public debate / discourse about deep and significant structural changes to the Minneapolis police department. Neighborhood discussions, similar to what was done by the park board as they solicited input on park proposals, would be hugely helpful and would allow members to hear directly from their constituents. Having a short “cooling off” period before those meetings would allow cooler heads to prevail and a more thoughtful discussion to occur. I understand the urge - and necessity - to act. But this rush to action without a plan is not the way to do it. I cannot, in good faith, agree to a change as significant as disbanding the police without a detailed understanding of what will replace them. Please, stand up to Councilwoman Bender - and the other members of the city council - and force a larger discussion about the future of policing in Minneapolis."
"6/30/2020 9:49:57 AM",-7,"","","We need to reorganize the police department, not replace it. One of the first steps should be to get completely rid of the union. Without a union, you can then more easily respond to complaints against individual officers so that they can be disciplined and fired. If an officer uses excessive force, that should lead to dismissal, not repeated tolerance of that behavior. Also, the city needs to change the level of immunity these officers are given when a lawsuit is filed. It angers me, as a tax paying citizen, that I am paying for officers’ bad behavior. They should be held legally and financially responsible."
"6/30/2020 9:50:38 AM",4,"","","Please do not approve the charter proposal as it is currently written. I believe that further study is needed before something this important is put before the voters. The current proposal is vague and smacks of a political power grab. A change this huge requires a specific proposal before changing the charter. Thank you for allowing my input."
"6/30/2020 9:50:41 AM",14,"","","I think that you will find Police Officers in General are pretty Good at following directions and following Policy, Reform  and tightening of regulations would be much better than doing away with and trying to rebuild something else.  I will not be coming to Minneapolis  if the Police  Dept is done away with for lack of feeling secure. I think you might find that such things as conventions will also stay away. Your decisions affect more than just those that are within the city limits. I also believe that in a short sentence, the idea that you have to be progressive to be successful is a pipe dream.  You have to be fair, and Justice needs to be swift and sure, and that has not seen daylight in Minneapolis, or Minnesota for years."
"6/30/2020 9:51:15 AM",-2,"","","I feel the proposed amendment is ridiculous!  Leave the police department intact, the way is."
"6/30/2020 9:51:20 AM",-5,"","","I have been a resident of Minneapolis up until a few months ago, and I would like to say that the Minneapolis police department has never made me feel safe. They never have their weapons fully holstered and tend to bring more violence into domination abuse situations, and their responses to the recent protests honestly just make me happier that I left."
"6/30/2020 9:52:31 AM",0,"","","I think the police department should stay in place!! Do not defund/disband them.... support them instead. They have a very hard job and need help. Weed out the bad officers, but keep the department."
"6/30/2020 9:52:34 AM",4,"","","Clearly the Minneapolis police department requires a reset when it comes to setting expectations for police behavior. Minneapols needs to be safe for everyone and a successful police force is part of that goal.  If the police union insists on being able to put fired cops back on the force through arbitration, then the governor or the attorney general should be given the final opportunity to restrict whether a fired police officer can return to work.  The police union or pension should be partially or fully responsible for paying settlements against police officers who don’t follow policy.  New police officers should be required to pass an aptitude test that includes psychological profiling.  Police officers should be required to have body cameras running at all times when interacting with the public. No exceptions. Failure to turn on body cameras should be subject to immediate dismissal.   Fired police officers should lose their pensions or at very least a significant portion of their pensions.  Policy reform should be subject to community review and approval.   Minneapolis/Minnesota  should create a database of police officers with a grading system that is open to the public.  The police work for the people.  Anything short of establishing that as that as the primary goal for the police force would be a failure of setting correct expectations.  Police officers should be provided the opportunity to increase their pay with a bonus system that is measured against a variety of achievable expectations. Failure to achieve minimum expectations should be grounds for dismissal. In corporate America this is called force ranking the value of the employees and its used to weed out bad employees every day.  And finally good police officers should be celebrated and held up as examples for other officers to follow."
"6/30/2020 9:52:41 AM",11,"","","I appreciate the Council’s commitment to developing innovative approaches to safety that work for all Minneapolis residents. I do, however, share many folks’ concerns about the lack of specifics regarding what a replacement for MPD might look like thus far. Given the gravity of the changes under consideration, I would need to see a detailed plan, developed over a significant period of time in collaboration with the community and vetted experts PRIOR to voting for a charter revision. I understand that this would mean investing a lot of folks’ time and energy into a plan that might not ultimately come to pass, but I don’t think it’s fair to ask Minneapolis residents to vote for an alternative public safety model without knowing exactly what the proposed model entails. Clearly, the changes being considered have dire implications for Minneapolis residents, particularly for the less-privileged among us for whom relocating is not an option if things are implemented ineffectively. This is an extremely important and delicate undertaking, so please give it the time and attention it deserves."
"6/30/2020 9:53:04 AM",0,"","","Please move this forward. The Minneapolis police department is beyond reform and must be rebuilt from the ground up.

"6/30/2020 9:54:00 AM",7,"","","I have lived all of my life in South Minneapolis. Grew up on the 3800 block of 15th Avenue and raised my family on the 3700 block of 1st Avenue. All this to say I've been a long time resident, supporter and cheer leader in Minneapolis. For many years I have worked hard to improve the quality of life in my neighborhood and city. I have been disappointed for some time now with the focus and direction of city leadership. A cities strength is in it's residents. Residents who are diverse economically and racially. I grew up in a city with an incredibly mix of industry, jobs, rich, poor, races, immigrants and arts. This can no longer be said of Minneapolis. We have become poorer in so many ways, our middle class is hollowed out, and I am no longer as proud of my city as I once was. I do not accept our decline as the inevitable result of globalization. Plenty of other cities have done better and we should have too. I don't want to be insulting, but I do not understand the reality the city council lives in. It does not seem to be mine. The police have been the only protection we've had over the years, helping and guarding against the many predators a declining city creates. I can't count the number of times my garage has been broken in to or spray painted with graffiti. That's my experience and my reality. I don't really like the police all that much but I fear much more a progressive alternative. Sorry to say the progressives haven't gotten all that much right since the civil rights movement of the 60s (which I was a part of and remember well). My suggestion for city leadership is to stop working on easy silly, and in the long term mostly worthless initiatives (like bike paths). We have bigger problems than that. The more important (and harder) quality of life issues are simply jobs, education, drugs, mental illness, and the homeless. And top among those are job creation and public education.  We cannot keep or attract middle class families without good jobs and a good education for children. So work on the hard important stuff and quit wasting time on the silly stuff like defund the police and other social experiments. Be national leaders in actually finding real long term solutions, not just doing copy cat ""flavor of the day"" initiatives that only ""kick the can down the road."" We've wasted enough time on that already, and it's not working."

I am not comfortable, however, with disbanding our police force without other detailed plans for providing for safety and security are established and approved by key decision making bodies.  I like the name of the proposed new department and what it signifies.  We need to learn from St Paul and other cities that have made substantial changes to improve policing and implement proven/tested approaches.  I think a root cause of problems now is the lack of meaningful gun control legislation in our country.  When police must go into settings every day where their lives are at stake we are not setting them up for promoting safety and preventing harm, as they must always be on high alert against being killed."

Social workers and peace officers will not have the authority to stop many law-breaking citizens.

We also need to diminish the power of the police union. Even so, officers (in their current state) provide a very valuable service to our city. Based on comments to national and local publications on this topic, changing the charter and giving the council broad authority to wipe this service out without a clear and specific plan is largely regarded as senseless.

It is also clear that there are things that need to change and the level of frustration runs high and deep. I do believe however the suggesting banning the police is very irresponsible and sends the wrong message. I also believe that if we were to disband the police it would be a disaster in terms of the rise of crime to all people groups.  Many if not most of the police have served this city very well. I would also say that I have had numerous interactions with police throughout the years as we are involved in active Street ministry in downtown Minneapolis and the surrounding regions. The police have been of great assistance and there have been a few instances what protection was needed. The actions in the behaviors that we witnessed of the police was appropriate, helpful and appreciated. I believe then at least in part the strong police Union defending police officers when they are being disciplined should be strongly looked at. I truly believe that accountability is a must and the union should have little to no say over appropriate disciplinary action taken toward the police. There would also need to be accountability for this review board process.  One suggestion would be to have a review board made up of citizens with the  appropriate demographics of people living in the location of the police jurisdiction.  Police should not be allowed to even develop a history of abuse.  One offense should bring this to light with a second infraction leading to termination.

Reform is one thing but abolishing the police dept is impulsive, ludicrous and a direct threat to me, my family and the safety of all Minneapolis residents! The City Council's vote to disband without a clear plan in place as to how to protect our community is reckless. What happens when the average citizen is threatened? Do you suggest we too hire private security at the rate of $4500 a week? Who’s going to eat those costs?  Right now the police have their hands tied because they aren’t being allowed to do their jobs, therefore, shooting, robberies and the like have all risen. It’s like the Wild, Wild West out there. Since May 25th, over 100 people have been shot. I have not heard a peep from the City Council about this spike in violence since their pledge to dismantle the police! Is this what our community is going to look like without police? I don't like it!! I also dont agree with how the City Council is back dooring the MAYOR, taking away his Executive power to VETO with this CHARTER AMENDMENT because he disagrees with this asinine idea of dismantling the police department. There are clear rules in local government and the City Council is overstepping their boundaries. The City Council is not authorized to interfere with the administration of city government. Council members may not give orders to department heads or to other city employees, they are policy makers not the administrator! This Charter amendment gives the City Council way too much power that may cross over to other areas of the City Departments!! The City Council is trying to hijack the City by taking away the power of the Mayor and City residents! Just like they (City Council) are now, making us residents pay for their own private personal security, while we live without ""security"" of the police!"

"6/30/2020 10:00:11 AM",17,"","","I’ve lived in Minneapolis for almost 10yrs. I have loved being a part of it and building a small business that’s thrived over the last 5yrs, which unfortunately was lost during our shut down. One of the many things that helped that shop be such a success was it’s ability to bring folks together, regardless of race/creed/religion/sexual orientation/job. I’m concerned that the city counsel is actually doing the exact opposite of what my little barbershop managed to do. It’s causing great divide. It’s short sided for the economy, and more so for its residents. Businesses don’t want to drop their anchor in a city that’s being ran on radical ideas. They will pack up and leave. The hot housing market will not be hot much longer. The very things that we have available in use and help folks out of poverty, will go away. Defunding and abolishing a police dept in a major metro area like Minneapolis is like removing insulin from a diabetic and replacing it with essential oils. I beg of our counsel to please listen to the overwhelming majority. We aren’t racists. We love our city. We love our police officers, and are hurt with the pain the city has been in these last few months. It won’t get better by removing a group dedicated to serving and protecting others. Focus on building up our police. Supporting our communities doesn’t mean you have to choose cops or civilians.  Be realistic in your approach.  You have a community of almost a million people that I guarantee you can ask for help from. I am one of those people."

We need to have reform, build community programs, offer counselors and de-escalators for many situations, however there is always the danger of people who are under the influence carrying a weapon.  Domestic abusers may attack a social worker, people who are just arguing may pull out a knife or a gun.  We need tough laws protecting citizens from police abuse and profiling.  We need to get rid of officers who can't treat everyone equally.  We need to get Kroll out of the union.  If the police disband and crime drastically increases, how long would it take to rebuild a police force?  It would take years.  Nobody would want to apply for the job after the city disbanded them.  What would citizens do to stay safe in those years of rebuilding?  There would be chaos."

There are areas in North Minneapolis where people are afraid that their homes will be broken into and they will be killed or robbed or raped. I know, I have lived there for 15 years. If you take away the police, you take away our protection. Then people will resort to taking the law into their own hands. Do you want to see people shooting each other in the streets? I think you do honestly. Democrats are dividing us more than ever. Trust me, disbanding the police will help no one,  not innocent people, black people, white people, Asian people, etc. It will only bring chaos."

"6/30/2020 10:03:17 AM",-6,"","","I do not support the defunding of the Minneapolis police department.  The amendment changes the requirement of a mandatory police force to an optional police force.   I cannot imagine the flight out of the city if the council is successful in this fools errand.  This will result in a replication of Detroit.   I won't re-elect Steve Fletcher and will in fact, actively campaign against him. If you believe Minneapolis is safe enough to abandon the police department, give up your personal security detail.   And Lisa Bender's public comment that she could see a future without police and we should call our friends and neighbors for defense; I will not protect anyone else's body or property from injury.   If this becomes a reality, I predict there will be a lot of armed citizens involved in ""shoot first ask questions later"" situations.  Not to mention the abandonment of the downtown businesses.   This is the best way to erode the tax base and ruin the city.  But I'm sure all of this will fall on deaf ears."
"6/30/2020 10:03:44 AM",-6,"","","Reform yes.  Dismantle no.  Yes, get rid of the ""bad"" officers. It is ignorant and irresponsible to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention  Department.  Add the department, sure.  Reform yes.  The immediate changes that have passed are good. The authority of a Police presence brings more comfort and security than it would be to see personnel in a Safety Prevention ""uniform.""  It'll be a security guard without authority.  More will happen with out of state and local ""thugs"" who think, ""Yes, lets go to Minneapolis; no police there!""  And, it's a fact not often mentioned blacks killing blacks, white killing white, etc. The City Council did not intelligently think this through and acted in haste to say dismantle without a parallel plan. For example, you don't run a new software program without running a simultaneous, parallel with the older program to work out the bugs. Preventive counseling and education won't singly fix human nature. It should be said, ""Yes, we have a Minneapolis Police Department with ongoing changes and reform. We've added a  Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department to assist our proven,  selfless, dedicated-to-upholding-the-law police officers. You are still safe.""  Ha, I won't visit Minneapolis functions for quite awhile under the current circumstances. Community is essential, but I'm not going to call my neighbor when I need assistance in a dire situation.  I could say more; but bottom line it is wrong to dismantle MPD. Thanks."
"6/30/2020 10:05:19 AM",-9,"","","The public needs a police force.  It can be very similar to what we have but the mental health reform needs to be done for the police force on a regular basis. Screenings for issues and help given regularly.  If any mental health issues are developing or agression issues towards anyone on the job OR in personal life are found the officer is taken off the streets permanently.  Without the force we will have a bigger gang problem and we cant handle what we already have developing.  I have worked with children who have mental health issues.  Yes they need to be treated as such. However that situation can change to a violent and aggressive situation on a dime and will need restraints to protect others and themselves.  I dont live in MPLS. And I wont go there without a strong police presence. Businesses will suffer and crime and violence will creep."

"6/30/2020 10:05:41 AM",1,"","","I appreciate the spirit and intention behind the changes; however, I have concerns that changes are being suggested are reactionary/knee-jerk responses without sufficient input from the broader population of Minneapolis. Asking for online feedback limits input to those with access to technology and providing in person discussion forums during a typical work day with minimal notice on the specifics limits access by individuals with limited transportation, childcare, and flexible work arrangements. I would like to see  considerably more in person efforts being made to get input so that ALL voices are heard - taking into consideration the various languages spoken by our community as well. As to the specifics of the charter: 7.2 - renaming the police department - it's a start and directionally correct in my opinion 7.3 - I believe the mayor still should have power over the department - in my experience if everyone is in charge then nobody is in charge and accountability diminishes. We NEED accountability DESPERATELY 7.3a - I'd like to see the details behind ""adequately fund"" and how the department will ""consistently engage"" the public - see previous concerns about how voices in our community are consistently overlooked. I would also like to see details here about what types of public safety services are included. 7.4c- I appreciate the removal of the fire police; and would like to see what is proposed in place of that role being eliminated. We saw during the nights of violent protests that fire was a significant factor in public safety and many fires went unattended with average citizens banding together to limit the spread of the fires but without sufficient resources to do so 8.4.4 - I see the removal of the police chief in this section. If you are proposing in section 7.3 that the police chief is replaced by the Director of Law Enforcement Services Division, this section should continue to reflect that this role cannot go vacant for more than 30 days. I would suggest keeping the language of ""or 30 days in the case of..."" and adding ""the Director of Law Enforcement Services."" We simply cannot go an entire quarter without this critical role being occupied."
"6/30/2020 10:06:01 AM",5,"","","Please do NOT do away with the Minneapolis police.  I am long term resident of north Minneapolis.

"6/30/2020 10:06:46 AM",2,"","","I am reaching out today as a concerned citizen, Minneapolis resident and longtime Minnesotan. As the council and its proposed charter stands today, there is nowhere near the amount of detail, educated and research proposed reforms, and measurement of progress needed to make this a success. Toppling the status quo, for better or worse and rushing to put in place a half-baked set of actions is not progress and not what the city and it's leaders owe the residents.  I expect better of our council and politicians. There needs to be a dedicated group of individuals overseeing the gradual (not immediate) implementation of new tactics and measuring there initial and long-term effects. Furthermore placing the power to enact this upon highly emotional, easily skewed voters is reckless. We elected our leaders to lead, now is the time to do so."

The citizens have lived in constant fear for the past month as our city was looted, burned to the ground as the government enabled and encouraged the destruction.  We can't even go the grocery store without the fear of getting shot, robbed or ran over.  We need our police department but we're terrified to voice our needs out of fear of being killed for expressing our support.  I moved to Minneapolis because of the police department.  It was the first time in my life that I felt safe, until politicians used them for their own political agenda in an election year."
"6/30/2020 10:09:40 AM",-13,"","","I think it is a very bad idea to disband the police department.  Who is going to protect the citizens from mentally unstable individuals that may be armed.  Or from armed criminals that are intent on stealing from honest citizens.  Bad idea. Attached: Friends and neighbors, please read what I am about to write.  George Floyd’s murder is deplorable, and I pray justice is served. I think that, my husband thinks that. The world thinks that. I will continue to support the protesters and the community as it grieves. My heart breaks for his family, and I listened as they decried the violence that arose around the periphery of what was otherwise a powerful, peaceful demonstration that spanned multiple days and nights. They are incredible. I would prefer to talk about nothing else other than that tragedy. I do not want to distract from what matters.  But the city council has apparently resolved to disband the MPD. And so I need to briefly address what that means. I am sitting a few feet away from the plaque on the wall commemorating my husband’s 2017 1st-precinct officer of the year award. He was given it for a demonstrated pattern of selfless and professional conduct, but in particular due to a specific call where he risked his life to save a woman who was being sexually assaulted downtown. He tackled and fought with her assailant. She crawled into the squad car and pleaded for help on the radio. My husband’s coworkers assumed he was dead. Not far from that plaque is the letter the victim wrote him afterwards, thanking him for what he did. We were notified he was given this same award for 2019, and thus nominated for overall officer of the year. We would have found out if he was given that award at a ceremony that was postponed due to Covid-19, and now I presume forever.  That is fine. This year has been indelibly marred by a horrible killing. We don’t need to give out awards. He would tell you that it’s silly to give him an award because he works with people who save lives every night.  You wouldn’t have heard about the call above or any other case like it, because it’s a private matter for the victim. But also we can’t count “lives saved,” only lives lost. Most of my friends are completely unaware of the number of incidents every night—some routine, some life-and-death. Some of my friends are urging that Minneapolis defund or disband the police, online from their developed community in a suburb. They wouldn’t see that the overwhelming majority of the calls for help he responds to every night are from communities of color. And he goes because they are our neighbors and he wants to help them and protect them. Minneapolis itself is a community of color, and he works here because he loves Minneapolis. If he wanted to collect a paycheck and kick up his feet, there are plenty of affluent suburbs in which he could do that. That’s every year. Every week. This past week has been extraordinary. He worked 105 hours last week. He came home with bleeding scrapes and bruises from rocks and moving debris. He had piss and molotov cocktails thrown at him. I waited up throughout the night worried that he would be the next officer killed in this country-wide violence.  So. If you know us and think he is irredeemable and should be fired, I am asking you to tell me that now. Here or to my face. Don’t hide behind a retweet or a hashtag.  If you think the MPD must be disbanded, you need to say that to your supposed friend and his family. Because that’s what this means. MPD is not a faceless bogeyman, although if you are only looking in from a safe neighborhood or suburb, I understand why you might think that. MPD is people. Sons, daughters, husbands, wives, people of color, immigrants, indigenous people. People.  Like any organization, some officers are a disgrace and should be punished. We saw that in Derek Chauvin this past week. We know that there is systemic racism in all of our institutions—the legacy and wounds of slavery and segregation run deep. We need to expose and acknowledge the lingering poison of our history.  That poison, that systemic pain is real. But we are all part of that system. Every cop, every teacher, every government official. Me, you. The way we move towards justice is by taking the hands of those within those organizations who want to do the right thing and by walking forward with them. Not by pointing fingers and saying “one bad apple spoils the bunch.” Were that true, we would have nothing at all in Minneapolis. No schools, no city council, no social services. We need to implement reforms that work. We need to talk openly about the problems and make changes. We need to remove those officers who will not walk forward with us. We must not make ourselves feel righteous by obliterating a group we see as outside ourselves. We need to think and be deliberate, not rash. Otherwise we will march into a future where affluent communities hire armed security forces, and our underserved communities burn to rubble. We’ve seen a glimpse of what that could look like. I understand that I am coming to this from a biased place. My husband is a cop. But believe me when I say, if his time on the force ends, my life gets easier. My blood pressure goes down. We’re both college-educated professionals, we’ll be fine physically and financially. But his heart will break because he loves Minneapolis. He didn’t get into this for money or power or fame. And despite what makes the news, he is not alone. I know many others on the force just as dedicated and just as brave and just as honest as he is. Don't throw them away."

Your collective actions and inactions recently have been an embarrassment to yourselves and the city. My political views are left of center and I vote primarily Democratic, I own property and pay taxes in Minneapolis, and I find this proposal to be ill-considered, juvenile and dangerous.

More after school programs, park programs, youth mental health services. We under-resource poor communities and then think policing is going to solve that?

Many of our members are minority members of the community near there. Instead of defunding the police, we need to give them MORE funds so they can continue to protect us and also create more community involvement programs to connect with them. There is not any organization that does not have some bad people, including the church, but to dismantle a vital service like that to cater to the loud voices of a few violent people who don’t even represent the community is a very short-sighted and disgraceful disservice to the community at large. Why don’t you consider supporting the good instead of catering to the bad?"
"6/30/2020 10:12:58 AM",-8,"","","I am disappointed with the lack of wisdom and discernment the Minneapolis City Council members are showing in this quick act to defund and/or abolish the police department.   It appears that decisions are being made without any feedback or communication with the people living in this city. It also appears that there is hardly a plan for what is to take the place of the police.   We live right in the thick of all that has been happening.  I feel that this Powderhorn neighborhood has been either completely abandoned or severely unsupported by any form of law enforcement.  How is anyone to feel safe if there are no consequences for harming people or property in this neighborhood?  You are elected officials.  You are the leaders here.  It is your responsibility to come up with a real plan to keep order and build this community."
"6/30/2020 10:13:06 AM",-9,"","","What's the actual plan for a Division of Law Enforcement Services? It's absurd to think that elected officials are calling on the public to disband/defund a major metropolitan area's police department, and not have a feasible, written, clear cut plan in place. 1. Number of POST licensed, sworn peace officers 2. Number/qualifications/on-call/available status of crisis/mental health emergency responders 3. A definitive action plan 4. What is the plan to coordinate with medical emergencies in a possibly dangerous, unsafe area. See ""scene safety"" as defined through the NREMT (National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians) Since none of this is even mentioned in the proposed charter amendment, or any other conversations coming out of City hall, I would most certainly vote ""no"" to defund MPD."

In regard to the “Division of Law Enforcement Services” - I hope change is not limited to changing the usage of the word ""police"" to ""Division of Law Enforcement Services"".  If that is the case, it seems like nothing more than a political gesture lacking sincerity. Some might even call it pandering.  How will you work to make sure that organization doesn't repeat the same problems as the current set up? What will become of current police employees? In addition to them being employees, some of them are also your constituents and residents of the City of Minneapolis.   If they are laid off, what benefits are they due? What types of binding contracts with the police union are there, if any?  Will this change subject the City (and its taxpayers) to lengthy and expensive lawsuits."

I am interested to see what this new “public safety” crew could look like. I agree with having money funneled towards other mental health or social worker departments. There have been times I’ve refrained from using 911 because it felt like too much, but it was after hours and 311 sometimes seems like a joke. Why does it take 25 neighbors posting daily on 311s website to get a dangerous pothole filled or someone to come talk to a neighbors shooting off illegal fireworks daily? I wish there was someone else to call in those less emergent cases. I think there is a lot of fearing around “defunding police” right now because people don’t quite understand what the violent emergency response team would look like. The problem in the city to me has been the immunity police officers feel because of the union and lack of accountability. I do believe we have good officers therefor this mentality of FTP is something I cannot say. And I also believe that my Black neighbors and friends’ Lives Matter! They have seen and felt terrible oppression at the hands of the police, school issues, and housing problems. We’re talking primarily about police now though. In my perfect little world, we would have a department that can have unarmed officers/peace keepers that could respond quickly to less dangerous calls AND officers that are armed to respond to violent emergency calls. But 100% accountability just like with any other job! I recognize that their job is more dangerous, but they still must be held accountable. I’m worried that if we don’t have officers patrolling the streets, that more crime will continue/increase because people can get away with more. But I also don’t want my bipoc neighbors to feel fear at armed officers patrolling/being a presence. I seriously think this can largely be fixed with true accountability measures. I think officers should be required to meet the people they serve. I’m open to this new “force” but I’m also hesitant to completely reinvent the wheel in my own backyard. Other US cities have NOT done it successfully. Pushing the power and responsibility to state/county officers doesn’t actually fix the problem. It just shifts the blame. Don’t shift the blame/responsibility. Make officers take responsibility. Give police or this new force way more training with mental health scenarios. More support for their own trauma. Fewer weapons. I could say more, but I think I’ve already droned on long enough."

I do not see any reference to numbers of the law enforcement division- licensing- governing body- funding etc. the precious charted describes all of that. In addition why would we want someone without law enforcement experience?  Does this mean they can’t have LE experience or just that they also need additional experience.

I could give many suggestions, but let me focus on just one, residency.  I had a policeman live in the apartment complex behind me for a few years.  Crime in our neighborhood went down to almost none when he lived and often parked his vehicle there.  On the other hand, I spoke with a young, single police officer at our block party who lived in Woodbury, and I asked him why, and he said in so many words, that he wanted to live somewhere safer.  That is the wrong attitude and he should be made to understand why Minneapolis is a wonderful place to live, else leave the force. Add a Residency Clause to the Police Force Charter: The police chief and higher ranking officers must live somewhere within the borders of Minneapolis, just like the mayor and city council do.  Those who currently do not will be grandfathered in.  Then create incentives for the rest of the officers to live in the city:  a) offer partial housing stipends to encourage residency. We will save the money in lawsuits in the long run. b) make promotions take into account whether the officer lives in the city or not.  All things being equal, promote the officer who shows their dedication to the job by living in the city."

"6/30/2020 10:16:49 AM",-23,"","","Members of the Minneapolis City Council, I support the proposed charter amendment to replace the Minneapolis Police Department to establish a Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department. Years of unfair treatment and several high-profile killings of unarmed black people have shown the MPD and other urban police departments to be instruments, intentional or not, of white supremacy. The MPD's violent response to largely community unrest following the murder of George Floyd by its officers has laid bare a thinly veiled disdain and fear held by members of the department for the citizens of Minneapolis. The MPD spent roughly 10 days rioting in the streets of multiple neighborhoods with the acquiescence of the Minneapolis mayor and the governor. During this time they, in many well-documented cases, violated the rights of protestors, incited conflicts and did not attempt to de-escalate them, did not offer aid to bystanders or nonviolent protestors injured by their extreme tactics, and even attacked people attempting to offer medical help to the injured (which would be a war crime, if this were a war--many officers seemed to think it was). This disdain crosses racial boundaries and may be related to tension created by the distance between the most widely held political views of police department members and the most widely held political views of the people protesting in the city. Even if returning to the status quo were desirable, I don't believe it is possible after all that has happened in the last month. The existing Minneapolis Police Department, of which 92% of officers do not reside in Minneapolis, does not belong in this community; in fact, they are actively hurting the community with their presence. In replacing the police department, I think it would going a little too far to entirely bar the involvement of former officers in the new department(s) that will take its place. However, I do not think it would be going too far to say that MPD officers who do not live in the city should be involved in the replacement; they should find something to do in their own communities, or if they must work in Minneapolis, they should find a position that does not require a sensitive understanding of this community. I also do not think MPD officers, whether they live here or not, should be allowed to hold prominent leadership roles in the new department(s); they could be rank-and-file, but they should not be heavily dictating the new direction we head in. Thank you for your time and consideration"

The rhetoric coming from the council is dangerous and your plan is not even detailed to any level sufficient to propose such a measure so your comments and steps are irresponsible and premature at best to say the least.  It is not lost on the public that this situation happened on your watch and evolved  during your tenure.  You have sat by and approved settlements for the department for years and were knowledgeable that a problem existed.  Your attempts at defunding appear to be your ducking your role and responsibility for the current situation. What you do in Minneapolis will affect every community surrounding Minneapolis boarders too and must have neighboring community approval and support. You may be appeasing some member voices in your community, but I doubt you will be able to get majority voter support for such revolutionary ideas when evolution of department policy and legal/judicial system is all that is needed."

If the city does disband the police, my company said they will guarantee that the company moves out of Minneapolis to ensure the safety of the employees.  This would mean all the money spent on rent for our offices, parking, client entertainment, employees buying lunch, etc., will all be going away from Minneapolis and taken to a city that has police to help ensure the safety of the employees. I did also hear from multiple other companies in our building that are planning to do the same because their employees are frightened to even come to Minneapolis already.  All the dollars going to Minneapolis would be lost from these companies as well if they were to leave due to the police being disbanded and raise of crime. This should be something to consider when looking to take away the safety for all these companies and all of their clients that come to Minneapolis.  Everyone already sees the huge increase in crime with the current police and everyone is saying that if the police are gone, they know it will be worse and all the companies I have spoken with, guaranteed they will be leaving the city.  With the national news about over 118 people shot in the last month, all of our clients are already refusing to come to our office because they fear the violence is already to high to bring their employees into the city.

"6/30/2020 10:26:17 AM",2,"","","The Minneapolis police department requires changes when setting expectations for police behavior. Minneapolis needs to be safe for everyone and a successful police force is part of that goal. A big change I feel is necessary is that  officers should have to carry personal liability insurance such as doctors have to carry malpractice insurance. They may not act as police officers without this insurance in place. When they misbehave (such as excessive use of force), their insurance pays for this. If they have too many misdeeds, they become uninsurable and thus unemployable. If the police union insists on being able to put fired cops back on the force through arbitration, then the governor or the attorney general should be given the final opportunity to restrict whether a fired police officer can return to work. (Again, if they can't get personal liability insurance due to these acts that initially resulted in firing, they can NOT return to duty). The officer's pension should be partially or fully responsible for paying settlements against police officers for offenses not covered by their personal liability insurance. This would help to reinforce that their actions outside of allowable actions have significant consequences. Their actions will impact their livelihoods and futures. Fired police officers should lose their pensions or at very least a significant portion of their pensions New police officers should be required to pass an aptitude test that includes psychological profiling. Look at other countries who require significantly more training. They have significantly fewer issues to the degree of our police force. Let's increase training in ALL of these areas. Police officers should be required to have body cameras running at all times when interacting with the public. No exceptions. Failure to turn on body cameras should be subject to immediate dismissal.   Minneapolis/Minnesota should create a database of police officers with a grading system that is open to the public. High performing police officers should be celebrated and held up as examples for other officers to follow. Police officers should be provided the opportunity to increase their pay with a bonus system that is measured against a variety of achievable expectations. Failure to achieve minimum expectations should be grounds for dismissal. Policy reform should be subject to community review and approval.  Law enforcement officers work for the people.  Anything short of establishing that as that as the primary goal for the police force would be a failure of setting correct expectations."
"6/30/2020 10:26:48 AM",-5,"","","I will firstly state that I am NOT for the de-funding or abolishment of the Minneapolis Police Force.  The police are in place to protect to the people and the businesses of the city in which they reside. A city without the police force is a call to all criminals to take advantage of the situation and manipulate and exploit the city and its citizens, and place them in harms way. You cannot trust people to be inherently ""good"" in order to reduce crime, this is a fallacy. You can already see this violence occurring, and increasing around all of Minneapolis. With the report of 1600 gunfire and tens of shootings reported over the past 30 days, it is a sign that police need to be in our communities to protect its citizens.  Police are here to maintain peace and handle multitude of situations in a moments notice before incidents become dangerous. Relying on ""Community Safety"" or social workers to diffuse potentially dangerous situations safely and quickly without force is a pipe dream. Sometimes the use of force is the only way to subdue criminals before they can cause great harm to others.  What I am I supposed to do if some one enters my home when the police no longer exist? Hope a social worker or safety officer politely asks them to leave? It just doesn't work.

The amendment does not specify how the Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department will be funded. 7.3(a) specifies that the City Council ""adequately fund"" the Department, but this leaves the funding open to the whim of City Council members. 7.3(c) which is proposed to be stricken could be re-written to specify the approach to funding and staffing the proposed Department. 2. Section 7.3(b) outlines that the City Council may maintain a division of law enforcement services, composed of licensed peace officers. My opinion is that the language should say ""must maintain"", making it a requirement for the city to have law enforcement services, regardless of calling it police force or any other name. I think by making law enforcement completely optional, the amendment goes too far, making it also possible to have zero public protection of our persons and enforcement of our laws when needed, which could be detrimental to our constitutional rights."

"6/30/2020 10:29:37 AM",-40,"","","Minneapolis has a history of violence, especially deadly violence.  If you choose to disband the police, citizens like myself won’t feel safe in the city. Eventually the city will lose money because people will take their business elsewhere due to safety concerns for themselves and their family. This effect will force businesses to close and move out of the cities, and will eventually trickle down and affect youth programs.   Example:  Minneapolis continues to have violence in the city on a daily basis.  Minneapolis police reform should take place instead of disbanding the police.  Mental health is a big issue for both citizens and police officers who deal with crime or commit crime on a daily basis. When a police officer performs his job day in and day out, he loses the ability to rationalize situations without bias. When a perpetrator is on the ground, choke holds or knees on the neck should not be used. The ability to reprimand bad police officers with the support of their union is necessary. Mandatory testing before hiring a police officer to find out if he/she has traits that may lead to violence.  Training for officers on mental health situations and domestic and social violence on a weekly basis. If the officer has all the information they require and a mentally ill or drunk person runs from them don’t shoot them in the back (shoot in a leg or don’t shoot at all), pick them up later but call in the crime. Don’t have high speed chases in which some innocent person could be killed, get the license number or call in for backup.

The absence of police scares me more than the possibility of contracting covid-19 to the point where I’m uncertain if I would go to the airport. I certainly would not leave my vehicle there because I just plan on riots on this current day. This is not ok. I want to feel safe in my state, and in my country. I do not feel safe.

For the first time in 10 years of living in the city we are afraid for the future if the department is removed and questioning whether to stay or sell now, along with multiples of our neighbors. The Department needs much more clear guidelines on what to do in most situations, with actions to be held accountable if officers are not following those specific rules.  The police are needed, but need better direction, not removal. They also need to be able to call in for help with mental stability issues outside of what a peace office is charged to do and in other situations.  Get the police help so they can avoid situations taking them out of their specified duties, discipline the outliers and on conformers publicly, and remove the umbrella safety net of the Police Union arbitrators."

Why did police abandon the community they were hired to protect? They were not doing their jobs. Peaceful Protesters should be protected, arsonists and looters should be stopped.   End qualifying immunity. No one should be above the law. Police need to be held accountable for their actions. A Permanent database should be kept of all use of force or misbehavior that can be shared nationally to prevent the hiring of fired officers.  Other officers at the scene are required to intervene and report misconduct. They need to be trained to do so. Some cities have this training. Whistle-blowers needed.   Officers are supposed to respond and protect the communities they serve. If they do not they don't deserve the job.   Demilitarize police. Training should emphasize negotiation and safe de-escalation. What to do instead? The Police Federation should not be allowed to offer military tactic training that was eliminated by our last two police chiefs. Guns should never be used on unarmed non-violent people. After each incident the actions should be reviewed. Police who don't play by the rules should be fined and eliminated.  Police should live in the cities where they work. Those who cannot must do unarmed community service in those neighborhoods and paired with community partners like social workers or mental health workers while on duty.   Ban choke holds, teargas, and ribber bullets.   Hire more minority police.  Keep body-cameras on and recording.

All future officers of the new department shall never carry guns. The rare instance where a gun wielding criminal is active, sheriffs or other organizations can be called in. The new officers must never have access to guns so when a person seems them they will not become fearful of being shot. 4. All future officers of the new department must be licensed by a third party organization.

I think there needs to be better community relations between the police department and perhaps increase socialization between the police department and residence of specific neighborhoods.  I think to disband the police department will cause a significant increase in crime rates. The people who will take the most advantage of this would be the criminals which then puts the taxpayers at risk. As a high-paying tax payer, I would not feel nearly as safe as I currently do.  If there are specific neighborhoods that prefer to disband the police due to poor relations, statistics or current outcomes, the police can stop responding to phone calls in that area and those specific neighborhoods can implement the new “plan” from city council."
"6/30/2020 10:43:32 AM",-30,"","","The changing of the police department to the department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention is a step forward from only the police department. However, the charter fails to address the reasons of the need for change.  Dismantling, defunding, and abolishing the police and the police system within a hierarchical power system of government is the goal. By rebranding the police department into a community safety and violence prevention department, you bypass that change. Police officers (also known as peace officers according to the code of ordinance for many years) would still be part of the new department. This is unacceptable, as the reason to change the department is to not have police officers present. Changing their title and having them still present is the antithesis of what community safety and violence prevention promotes, as police are the violent threats to communities in Minneapolis.  On top of this, I worry about the funding that will be given to this new department. The hope is that the department will get all or the majority (after careful redistribution to needed programs) of the police budget; all $193 million. On the proposed 2020 budget, the Office of Violence Prevention only receives $2.5million, the neighborhood engagement and support $11million, youth violence prevention only $1.5M, and the police conduct review only $1M. The charter must address this financial and budgetary disparity, and understand that the money must go to programs that do not involve the police, and that the new department cannot be underfunded to provide the argument of its failure.  As we know, the police department for years has been over funded and still is a failure. With almost 100 complaints against officers per quarter, lawsuits for force and racial slurs by officers totaling close to $10 million every 5 years, and the use of body cameras, early intervention systems, and other changes to the department have all resulted in continued failure and repeated harm/killings of Minneapolis residents.  In conclusion, this charter amendment is a good first step, but it vague in its goals and ideals, which allows for the underhand continuation of the corrupt and harmful police to continue in this city and act as tangible threats to community members. The amendment to the charter must be explicit in the removal of police officers, the power structures they uphold, and the must focus solidly and concretely on the development and strengthening of the new department that prioritizes community members, de-escalation techniques that never include the presence of violence or weapons or officers, and restorative and transformative justice, in all aspects of its day to day operations."

Under the premise there is a reason to address police issues (and there definitely/clearly is), what about sitting down and fundamentally discussing the issues with all parties to arrive at steps to begin to resolve the challenges versus a kneejerk, emotional and irrational decision?  Additionally, under the brush that the ""whole"" police department needs to be eliminated, can you state for the public and rationlize the same could be said for politicans given there have been numerous examples of ""crime related"" issues within your profession?  Seriously, defunding the police equated across professions would mean: 1) Defunding of all politicans (and lobbyists for that matter). 2) Defunding of all businesses who misled others (Enron example) 3) Defunding of all teachers and education orgs who have misled the public and in the worst of cases taken the innocence of our children. To be 100% clear - I support systematic changes to the methods of policing and the absolute and full prosecution of the officers involved with Mr. Floyd's death.  But what I will not support in any way, shape or manner is a city who now believes that the way to solve this is eliminating law and order AND failure to enforce it (i.e. precincts, riots, etc).  And you can bet (with full vigor) that I (or my family) will not frequent  your community > and that I will advise others to go elsewhere.  Those voices, if you've not noticed, are already further damaging the image of Mpls and it's about to get worse if you go thru with this plan.

I personally don't think law enforcement background should completely exclude an otherwise strong candidate (think of someone who maybe was once a police officer but now leads a community social justice organization, for example). This is perhaps not included in the charter itself, but in regards to how this new Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention will function: * For the remaining Law Enforcement Services arm, how will we ensure those peace officers don't fall into the same biased policing practices as before? Will there be more community oversight for complaints against officers? * More transparency needed on how services will be funded by the City of Minneapolis Thank you for serving on our city council and thinking of how we can make ALL our residents and communities safer!"
"6/30/2020 10:46:34 AM",-12,"","","The removal of the Minneapolis Police Department is a danger to the residents of that city and the surrounding communities. Instead; a reassessment of practices, policy, and procedures should be done and a evaluation of individuals on the force and coming on the force should be assessed and changes should be made. What is happening in the community of Minneapolis is not the complete fault of   the individual choices of the Police Officers but also from the generational structure of negative cultural norms that have been passed down from generation to generation in some historical neighborhoods in Mpls.  Individuals of all color and cultures are responsible for their own actions and the consequences of it under the United States & State of Minnesota laws. Laws need to be in place and followed! Although, some compassion in those laws needs to be viable because people make mistakes and need to be able to make amends for them to learn and choose to do better.  To abolish the Police Force is asking for more problems and more degradation of the communities mental standards of what is right and wrong. Creating community groups with social workers & Psychologists should be secondary to police. Social structures need to be offered to assist in helping these communities have better opportunities for their people and better mental health support for all so they can have a choice to better their lives and not fall into the lifestyles that are negligent of the laws. Trust needs to be restored to help the people.  Dismantling the Police Department will not help it will only create more trouble. Making Minneapolis like it is its own country is going to be troublesome for its residents. The population diversity will shift drastically  The surrounding communities will suffer from this bad decision. Minneapolis will be become more poor with less businesses, less stable income. Poverty will attract more poverty, your crime, sex crime, drug crime, physical assaults, and lack of prosperity will increase because there will be no fear of Law Enforcement. I believe the community and has a psychological problem. Hire some  reputable Psychologists to help find answers to fix the social issues in Minneapolis. Understanding the how, why and what can be done may help.  Also, some people you just can't help because they don't want it and/or don't see their own destruction. You need to enforce laws for these people or just let them be their own demise as long as they aren't destroying other people's lives.  There is NO WAY to make everyone happy."

The City Council's proposals, statements and intentions related to the removal and/or dismantling of law enforcement will turn Minneapolis into a 'wild west' town. Where anything goes and you are on your own in protecting yourself, your property, your business. Exactly what happened during the civil unrest.  Exactly what is happening now. It may be a lovely ideal to create some kind of British style community policing model - but no one in Britain has a gun. That is certainly not the case here.  And if you don't already own a gun - the currrent rhetoric coming from the City Council suggests I better go get one. This is no way to run a major city in the 21st century. I STRONGLY oppose the proposed amendment.  The lack of funding and support from the City Council has already gutted the Police Department. Financially and morally. There is no longer a traffic division. This is obvious by the complete free for all behavior exhibited on our streets. The City Council's negative rhetoric denigrates good officers, reinforces the trenched behavior of bad officers and promotes the ""us vs them"" sentiment that supports the 'blue wall'   These tactics do nothing to move us forward in a positive way in any shape or form.

I also take Metro Transit to/from work 2-3 a week (outside of COVID-19). I have a background (e.g. Bachelors & Masters degrees) in Sociology and Criminal Justice. I am a Steward and proud member of AFSCME Local 34. I attended George Floyd's memorial service and the memorial at Cup Foods. I recognize the oppression the Black community has undergone in America and the world over, and understand that I will never understand. I recognize that change NEEDS to happen in Minneapolis, the United States, and all over the world in the way of law enforcement reform. I am not certain as to the best way to go about effecting this change, but I am certain that it is NOT by disbanding the MPD. Review hiring protocol, review current officers' records, make judgments as to whom stays and goes. Start by taking a close look into your contract with the police union. We (Minneapolis and the surrounding communities) have seen violent crime increase considerably in the past month, especially the last couple weeks. A city I once loved to frequent is now a city I fear to enter. While I recognize my privilege in being able to say such a thing, my fear would be that much more amplified if the MPD were to be disbanded. Community members, social workers, psychiatrists, etc. are not cut out nor trained to respond to 911 calls on their own. Community watch is an accessory to a well-functioning police department, not something to serve the same role as the police. Sex assaults, murder, trafficking, rape, and similar violent crimes are not going to be effectively nor well-handled by laymen. ""Community-based policing"" is the organizational strategy that should be employed here. It's time the MPD and the various communities it serves come together.

It's not a big deal for you, but the opportunities that MPLS receives will be drastically reduced.  Remember you get what you pay for and shifting money to another public safety system will not keep the peace - a.k.a: Law & Order.  Maybe the ammendment should increase funding which could be used to pay for additional training, more accountability and a larger MPD staff.  BTW - I thought the knee issue was addressed in an lawsuit MPLS settled several years ago.  If so there is an accountability issue on the table."
"6/30/2020 10:55:28 AM",8,"","","I strongly support the establishment of a community safety and violence prevention department. It is important to me that this department operates with recognition of systemic issues that contribute to crime. I believe that only a small task force should be equipped to handle truly violent situations, and that the majority of law enforcement must be specifically designed only to carry out a specific task (traffic enforcement being specialized, much like parking enforcement, etc.) I also believe that policing should reflect the community being policed, that extreme measures are taken to reduce gun violence and dangerous situations, and that preventative and rehabilitate measures are prioritized over retributive measures.  These programs will be more successful with broader social support implementation. Minneapolis is a great American city, and I moved here because of its high quality of life. It is in the long term interest of the city to implement experimental and creative solutions to modern problems. This should mean innovative climate change measures, radical public health/outdoor rec prioritization, socialized services, and high minimum wage in the coming years."

Reduction of the Police force also will tie the hands of all other Minneapolis emergency services of fire, ambulance, etc. as these personnel require police security for access control, street rerouting, crowd control to perform their work."

Do we really want a society where there is absolutely no accountability whatsoever?

"6/30/2020 11:02:29 AM",-19,"","","Hello,  Thank you for the opportunity to submit our thoughts on this proposed charter amendment. I do not agree with the City's proposed amendment to abolish the police and replace it with a ""Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department"". I believe that abolishing the police department and replacing it with various unarmed specialists will result in more crime. In fact, we have already seen this happen. Since the city council's announcement to abolish the police, we have seen 113 people shot, 8 fatally in the Minneapolis area.  Police are needed to respond to a wide variety of situations and diffuse potential dangerous situations quickly before more harm is done to innocent people. If there is no one to protect citizens, the people will take their protection in their own hands which will cause more harm. Personally I know that when I call 911, I would like someone to show up prepared for any situation.  As a result of the increase in crime and lack of protection, businesses and residents will begin to move out of Minneapolis. We have already seen this happen with businesses relocating after the riots and bars/restaurants shutting down due to violence. Additionally, I know many people originally looking to purchase homes in the Minneapolis area that have already shifted their search to the suburbs in fear of the increasing violence occurring in Minneapolis.  I do believe some reform within the police department is needed. We need to hold those people who have done things wrong accountable and insure our police are trained correctly. However, a full abolishment of the police force is not necessary and I think it will have more negative impacts than positive ones.  Thank you for your time."
"6/30/2020 11:03:21 AM",4,"","","I am excited that Minneapolis is looking to reign in the abuses of MPD and make positive change in our community. But I am concerned because I feel the process to change the city charter is rushed and there currently isn't a plan on how to create a new department. To put together language so quickly and push through a change to the city charter during a pandemic when we cannot hold public meetings and discussions concerns me. I feel that the City Council should be presenting a thought out plan to Minneapolis residents about what the new department of public safety will look like and then we we should vote on the charter change. It isn't even clear that there will be any peace officers. It wouldn't be required by the new language. At this point the process seems to be happening in the wrong order and it greatly concerns me. I believe we need to push off the vote on the change to the charter until 2021 when we have a real plan put together."

Look at the current state of violence in our city.  This is because of an ""idea"" on no police.  What do you think will happen if this actually goes through?  I am a home owner who will have no choice but to move if this was to happen and sadly I know home prices will drop.

Enough is enough and it’s time for changes to be made"
"6/30/2020 11:05:56 AM",-13,"","","It is disappointing that the city council and charter commission have not outwardly communicated with residents of Minneapolis, business owners, and the voting public and have given little to no time for those parties to review and comment on this amendment before a special meeting to be held July 1, 2020. The public commenting was posted only on June 29, 2020 to the Minneapolis City website (http://news.minneapolismn.gov).  Three days earlier, on the same website, the news posted was “The proposal has been referred to the Minneapolis Charter Commission for its meeting 4 p.m. Wednesday, July 8 and the City Council’s Policy & Government Oversight Committee for its meeting 1:30 p.m. Thursday, July 9.” There was no mention that prior to the meeting on July 8th that public commenting was open. Why has a special session been called one week earlier? Why were constituents informed only 48 hours in advance of this meeting and why were they not in a more public way other than just on Facebook or other social media? This shows that little to no effort has been taken to openly invite Minneapolis stakeholders to be included in this process.  Other residents of Minneapolis that I have spoken with and I have many questions about the current state of the police department, how the city is currently ensuring the public safety, and what the future would look like. This proposal does not clarify what this Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention would accomplish, just seems to be dismantling the current Police and naming of a new department. Presently, residents are uncertain about how their safety is ensured and perception is on a negative decline with current affairs.  Preliminary questions I have are as follows:  • Who will the director of the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention report to?  • What is the role of division of law enforcement services within the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention?  • How will the division of law enforcement services work in conjunction with the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention? • How will licensed peace officers work with Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention?  • How will Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention directors and other department employees be evaluated? Will they be licensed? What licenses will they hold and maintain?  • Who will Minneapolis residents be able to call on in time of emergency and have their safety warranted, especially in violent situations with personal harm to self or property?  • There is no Funding outlined for this Department. What taxes will be levied against property owners for this Department? How many employees per resident will be in this department? • What are the term requirements or term limits to the director of both the division of law enforcement services and Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention? • How will Fire Department and Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention work together?  • The ordinance states that “The City Council must establish, maintain, adequately fund, and consistently engage the public...” How will the public be engaged and what does that mean on an ongoing basis? I implore you to delay the charter amendment vote for a period that is sufficient to publicize the content of this ordinance/amendment, complete more outreach, and engage Minneapolis residents. This is a very important topic that has a lasting effect on the entire city and greater community. Residents may have differing perspectives on the proposed charter amendment, but they deserve respect of their city leaders that should keep residents informed and actually support community engagement and commenting even if there is a shortened timeline to get this on the ballot."
"6/30/2020 11:07:03 AM",-19,"","","This charter is concerning.  What do you mean by a holistic community oriented approach?  That needs to be expanded upon in great detail.  With the removal of our police department and the requirement for the minimum number of police officers (0.0017% of the population) being removed, as well as language such as “the city council MAY utilize a law enforcement DIVISION”, it sounds like they are being given the authority to use no law enforcement/peace officers.  I am born and raised in Minneapolis and with such a large diverse population with troublesome areas like North Minneapolis or south side around Lake street we NEED police officers to deter crime and enforce the laws that WE ALL agree to abide by. Putting aside the race aspect of why this charter is being revised (recently with George Floyds murder and police oppression against minorities) I believe this will only motivate the criminals who have or intend to commit crimes to do so in the future without repercussions.  They already do not abide by the law while the rest of us do and without a serious law enforcement agency what will prevent them from spreading crime into any and all other areas of the city? A holistic community peace keeping squad? Do I need to patrol my own streets?  If someone breaks into my home or assaults my family, Will I be able to call the police? Will they even exist? Because if this were to happen today I feel confident the police would help me and I do not want to lose that protection.  My concern here is that if the police department is dismantled and the City Council chooses not to have an acceptable number of law enforcement officers then crime will increase substantially, I will no longer feel safe living here and I would probably consider leaving my life long home to find a safer community.  I hope you can assuage my fears by expanding upon what exactly this new department will accomplish, because I do not think the City Council even knows all of the complications of what they intend to do here from this knee jerk reaction to everything that has happened the past few weeks.  This decision requires more time and deliberation AND I heard this public comment section is only open for TWO days? That is unbelievable and without the Nextdoor app I would not have known.  Another concern I have is that you insist the new director of this department must have NO LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE.  I understand what you’re trying to do here, and appease those who feel wronged by the current system or change up the system, but you’re giving this person with no law enforcement experience the absolute power to enforce the law and manage the actual law enforcement division (as well as choosing the director of said law enforcement division).  That.. doesn’t sound right. In my opinion and I’ve given this some thought, What SHOULD be done is adjust the policies and regulations of the existing police department. For a start Mandatory body cameras that CANNOT BE TURNED OFF Under any circumstance without punishment.  Every officer must be accountable for his actions, and there should be an active department to monitor for the “bad cops” that abuse or misuse their power.  The removal of qualified immunity in certain circumstances is a start. These riots came about from the helplessness our citizens feel knowing cops who commit grave injustices face no punishment.  It is the power of social media, the fact every person has a personal camera that we are beginning to find these bad cops. It shouldn’t be our job to expose these bad cops, actively do it from within their own departments."

I am not personally familiar with the discipline of community safety services, but I would support higher investment in education, especially in Black communities, increasing opportunities for young people, more investment in small businesses, more access to trauma-informed care and Black mental health and medical professionals. More investment in drug and mental health treatment facilities. More culturally -tailored approaches to wellness.  I think it's imperative to address systemic racism as a  public health crisis and I want to see and learn more about restorative justice approaches.  My biggest fear is angry white police officers and their backlash--thinking specifically about attitudes like police union director's Sgt. Anna Hedberg, seeing everyone in Mpls as a criminal and that she couldn't possibly live here with her beautiful daughters. PLEASE. How can attitudes like this be addressed in a constructive way?"
"6/30/2020 11:09:39 AM",-6,"","","I do not live in Minneapolis but have workEd at a school in North Minneapolis for almost 10 years. We work with children with severe emotional and behavior disorders. We frequently rely on support from MPD when children are having a mental health crisis that evolves into behaviors that are unsafe for school staff Or social workers. We’ve had students in the parking lot threatening staff, breaking into staff members vehicles. We’ve had staff jumped, assaulted, and robbed by students who were skipping school while the staff was on their way into the building. I can guarantee if you choose to get rid of MPD you are going to lose a lot of teachers. There are plenty of teaching jobs in surrounding suburbs. I do not feel safe working in a city with no police department. Provide more mental health training and resources to support MPD. Removing them is not the answer!"
"6/30/2020 11:09:41 AM",5,"","","This is absolutely not the right way to be handling this situation. In fact, the exact opposite should be happening. If you want a good and strong police department, give them more funding for training. Give them the opportunities to take more training in deescalation and community engagement. It's the police that help to get disadvantaged youth away from drugs and gangs. There also needs to be a change in the mindset of the public. Police officers and other first responders are not the enemy. The community is its own worst enemy. The individuals within the community need to respect one another and get away from this mentality that they always need to be fighting the police. Yes, there are some bad police officers just like in every profession. I know the public hates that those officers exist, but do you know who else does? The good officers. The ones that work so hard to try to be the best that they can be for themselves and their communities. It's not right or fair to treat them this incredibly poor. I would invite you to think of this entire situation from a different perspective and to seriously and honestly realize what you're doing to these individuals who have taken an oath to serve and protect your community regardless of what may come their way."
"6/30/2020 11:10:19 AM",24,"","","1. Courageous, innovative, successful police reform requires a clear understanding of the final desired result. Few existing processes that brought about positive transformations, like the reform of the police in Camden, had such a plan. At the end of the process, Camden had a more effective, less corrupt, but also larger police force. This was the intent of that reform in every step. Dismantling existing fundamental institution like a police department without this understanding is likely to bring chaos that will harm the community, in particular its weakest and less privileged sectors.  I see no such understanding and no such plan in the amendment proposed by the City Council. There is no introductory document, there is no explanation of the precise final state that the City Council is proposing. Someone looking for this vision in the statement released by the members of the City Council could not find it even in the press conference organized on June 26th.  Precise, repeated questions of the journalists involved were all asking ``Where is this process going?’’.  To these questions, we have only heard replies stating that ``We will find the answer later’’. This is unforgivable amateurish attitude, that is particularly dangerous considering how important the police department is in the functioning of a city. 2. Lacking a precise plan, or any plan in any form, the City Council has resorted to asking for all the power on the matter, with the implicit promise of coming up with something reasonable later on. In an unguarded moment during the June 26th press conference, council member Ellison clearly defined the true meaning of the amendment. He described it as addressing the need first to ``remove the charter as a  barrier now’’. What council member Ellison fails to understand is that what appears from his perspective as a barrier is, from the perspective of the citizen, a guarantee against the excess and arbitrary nature of future City Councils. He is not, and the City Council is not, an expression of la volonté générale. 3. Let us consider the specific proposal. There are two main changes in the document: 3.1. Deleting the paragraph 7.3. (c) which states that the City Council must fund at least 0.0017 employees per person. The new text has no provision restricting the number, which as a logical consequence may be as low as zero.  3.2. Deleting paragraph 2, in 7.3. (a), (2) on police (or peace) officers which states that they ``may exercise any lawful power that a peace officer enjoys at common law..''.  There is no provision in the proposed amendment defining what lawful power the new ``licensed peace officers''  may exercise, which may be as logical consequence no effective power at all. These changes would make perfectly legal a complete and permanent abolition of the police department. With these changes, Minneapolis could be legally in one year a city where law enforcement is in the hands of fifty social workers armed with a whistle. Removing these constraints without replacing them with anything clear takes away power from the citizens and gives them to the discretion of future City Councils. The City Council is asking the citizens to sign a blank check for the indefinite future, including the possibility that a council with such confused thinking may even resolve to do nothing.  4. The Charter Commission should reject the proposed amendment. Any future amendments should have criteria replacing the two mentioned articles clearly specified, and sufficient to guarantee enforcement of the law. If the Council wants a City with fifty peace officers, it should have the intellectual courage and the democratic spirit necessary to ask this to the electors."
"6/30/2020 11:10:32 AM",-22,"","","I think the city has a crime problem and not a police problem.  Sure some officers are a little hard on guys.  However they put themselves in contact with the police by breaking the law.  If you don't like police don't do illegal things or at least get good at it so you don't get caught.  I think defending the police would be a disaster.   The city is already one of the most dangerous cities in the country.  On par with Chicago per capita.   I moved out of the city 3 years ago when the riots started to get worse.  I honestly don't care either way as I have no reason to go into the cities anymore.  I just don't want the clean up in a few years to be a tax burden.  Let the communities take care of themselves no matter what the decision is.  My vote is to provide/require more training to the officers.  Also to hire based on qualification and no other criteria.  Hire the most qualified applicants."

"6/30/2020 11:12:55 AM",-4,"","","Reform does not work. The current system must be dismantled and rebuilt by the citizens of Minneapolis themselves. The new officers - however they're referred to in the future - must be residents of the neighborhood they protect. They must be held to a higher standard of the law than the people they serve, not a lower standard. They must not be able to commit crimes with little or no consequence. They must be liable for their own crimes legally and financially. I live in St. Paul and we need the same for our police department."

Will you take responsibility for the blood of the many many new victims of crime with your plan in place.  Also who polices and protects during events such as Super Bowl or Final Four? The city of MPLS. will lose millions and millions of dollars from these events not choosing Mpls. due to safety concerns. Who investigates murders? Who is called when a life threatening event is happening? I have question after question. How does the black communities where crime is high really feel about this? And I’m not talking about the Black Lives Matter corrupt organization!  I’m talking about the people and business owners.  I myself am moving out of Minneapolis, possibly Minnesota."
"6/30/2020 11:14:48 AM",0,"","","Stop the in fighting. Taking power from the Mayor is an unproductive power play. This action simply pr  ioritizes giving law enforcement to minority elected officials. You do not speak for the city and are letting egos and emotions drive decisions.  Please seek to recognize and address the root problems. When do you plan to address the corrupt Police Union? Kroll is problematic and extremely powerful. How will you 13 control the Union more effectively? You have done NOTHING to work with the Mayor to repair the problems.  Yes we need to develop alternative resources. Police do not need to handle overdose calls; We may not need police in schools and ;including mental health experts is smart.. These are actions that do not require a charter change. Where are you on these steps? Also, i propose selling off some/all of the military gear or forcing the police to respect the gear and be disciplined like soldiers. We need these changes.  However this is a smoke screen for a Council President power grab. You have not even tried to work  under the current power structure. Just because the Mayor uses different words and is not you favorite person does not mean tyou does not take away the office’s power. The Mayor was elected by the residents of the entire city unlike you City Council members Who are often elected without debates, active campaigning and most people do not even know who you are. .  And on that note, look at the City Councils results and clean your own doorstep. You too have allowed systemic racism to continue. Remember the closed streets in North experiment? Remember block e and the Nicollet Mall disaster?  And why did you invest in unused bike lanes vs community/social services? Why do you keep prioritizing investment in Southwest vs Henry, Roosevelt and South? What have you done to bring new opportunities and jobs to your ward? How are you addressing the homeless camps? What have you done to prevent crime and repair our justice system? The answers to those questions demonstrate what happens when minority representation rules by committee. If anything needs to change it is that the Mayor’s power should increase as this current structure is unproductive.  Thank you for your time and consideration. Please excuse any typos.

"6/30/2020 11:15:02 AM",92,"","","I support the amendment that would create a new Community Safety & Violence Prevention Department and remove the Police Department from the Charter.  I am a life long resident of Mpls, and served as a chaplain with the MPD for 3 years, 2013-16.  The att. doc offers my thoughts regarding that experience.  It contains very specific suggestions as to how community safety could be achieved. The current culture of the MPD is violent, racist, misogynistic, and unnecessarily militaristic. ""Reform"" has been tried, valiantly, by many people, for decades.  ""Reform"" has failed.  I am ashamed that our city has allowed so many people of of color to be mis-treated and murdered. We CAN dis-mantle the current structure and create a new one that emphasizes and truly supports COMMUNITY Safety.  We are a relatively small city.  We can contract with numerous other organizations to temporarily respond to 911 calls - The U of M PD, the Park Board PD, Metro Transit PD, first ring suburb PDs, to name just a few.  Additionally there are numerous community groups that could be utilized - activists, faith leaders, mental health professionals, neighborhood organizers can all be hired and deployed in various ways. Creating a new Community Safety & Violence Prevention Department from the ground up will take time - perhaps two years or more.  It will be painful and will require patience, compassion and deep listening.  I have faith in you, the leaders of our Beloved Community.   Attached: To: Assistant Chief Arneson I served as a chaplain with the Minneapolis Police Department. Jan. 2013 – July 2016.  During that time I assisted with death notifications, calls to the scenes of suicides, overdoses, and SIDS. I attended dozens of community gatherings, put in many hours with the Police Activities League and did over 30 ride alongs.  I am a life long Minneapolis resident, and have worked in ministry, education and social services for 30 years.  I currently serve as a chaplain for Breck School.   For the past two years, June 2014 - June 2016, the expectations for chaplains have been to attend roll call, do ride alongs, and attend community events.  One of each of these per month was the minimum expectation, but I often tried to do more.  I established relationships with the LGBQT community, faith communities, the Cedar-Riverside Neighborhood, and the PAL program.  On July 18 Dan Carlson and Jason Andersen asked me to submit my resignation.  They said that they did not see me “fitting in with the program”.   I was told that 1st precinct “didn’t want me”. I’m not sure what my mis-steps were that led to the request that I not serve the 1st precinct any longer.  I don’t know if I was unwelcome by a few officers, or many. All of my actions and words were intended to be helpful and supportive.   The lack of any meaningful introduction of the chaplain program to the officers was, I believe, a gaping hole that may have led to mistakes and mis-understandings.   (See addendum.)  I resigned with deep sadness and regret.  It was truly an honor to serve the MPD and our community.  I would be happy to serve again in the future, as a chaplain or in some other capacity, paid or unpaid.  I offer the thoughts below in the hope that they might be helpful as you continue the hard work of creating a safe environment for our citizens and officers. Deputy Chief Arradondo has wisely noted that regarding our current situation a “cultural shift” needs to take place.   Our situation is this: we all feel un-safe.  Maslow’s hierarchy of needs places Safety second only to the basic needs of physiology (food, water, air, shelter...).   We cannot progress as a society if the need for safety is not met.  We cannot rely solely on trainings and programs to do the heavy lifting necessary for this desperately needed cultural shift.  We need to look deep within our hearts and ask “Can we truly change how we go about protecting and serving our city?” MPD – “Para-military” or “Community Policing”? Many police departments in larger cities were formed as paid militia to protect the interests of the wealthy.  “Community Policing” is still a relatively new phenomena.  The imagined ideal is “Mayberry RFD” – officers who know their community so intimately and treat their neighbors with such great love that they are able to head off conflicts well before they become dangerous.  Yes, I know, we’re a city of 400,00 souls with 800 some officers, not a fictional small town with Andy Griffith solving problem in 30 minute segments.  Still, the question before us is; do we strive for an ideal, or do we accept our current reality of dis-trust, dis-respect, danger and death?  If we continue to do things the same way we will get the same results. Chaplain consultant Dan Carlson repeatedly described the MPD as a “para-military organization” to me.  Accepting a description of the MPD as “para-military” contradicts the MPD’s stated mission of “partnership with all communities”. Many officers embrace Community Policing, and just as many officers view themselves as warriors, prepared for combat.  The warrior attitude is easy to identify.  Statements that refer to “us vs them” or “I just want to catch the bad guys” can be addressed by leadership.  If the MPD continues to tolerate the “warrior” mindset then we will continue to endure policing that harms rather than protects, and puts officers at risk. Use of chain of command communication This is a strategy inherited from the military. It is effective and necessary in crisis situations, but when applied universally it leads to a lack of autonomy, productivity, and effective communication.  Community Policing requires compassionate listening, and honest, direct communication.  If chain of command communication is used exclusively within the MPD then there is no chance to practice more humane, adult ways of communicating.  Please consider encouraging MPD staff to speak to one another honestly, kindly and directly, and reserve chain of command communication for crisis situations and decision making.  This is a big “cultural shift” but if we continue to do things the same way we will get the same results. Lack of internal, intentional, guided support for staff and officers Working with a police department in any aspect is stressful.  That’s the nature of the job.  Including internal, intentional, guided support for staff and officers can alleviate some of  the stress by allowing staff to process emotions, brain storm solutions and alternative approaches, and feel support and encouragement from their peers.  Two hours a month of mandated, facilitated small group conversation can prevent some of the well documented risks of long term police work - burnout, bitterness, depression, suicide, chemical dependency, divorce.  “Mandated” might seem counter-intuitive, but we all know that no one would participate if it was optional.  There is a significant expense to this strategy, but it would pay off in a far, far healthier department.  This is an area that chaplains might be able to advise and assist with implementing.  Remember - If we continue to do things the same way we will get the same results. Policing as a lifetime career I have no solution for this, but it would be helpful to at least acknowledge that serving as an officer for 20, 30 years is simply too much to ask of people.  Burnout is inevitable.  Too often I’ve heard officers say things like “This work eats up your soul.  My soul is gone.”   If we continue to do things the same way we will get the same results. Residency So many officers live outside of Minneapolis.  Way outside of Minneapolis – Farmington, Elk River, Lino Lakes... According to 2015 data from MPD only about 5.4 percent of Minneapolis officers live within city boundaries.  They are not connected to our community, and it is my impression that many non-resident officers have little empathy for our residents, and more of the “us vs. them” mentality.  I’ve heard officers say “I’d never live here.  This is a horrible place.” And worse.  Please do all you can to create incentives for residency.  If we continue to do things the same way we will get the same results. Lack of consistent leadership for programs and precincts During my three year tenure as a MPD chaplain the program had five different leaders, plus a paid consultant.  I served under three different precinct commanders. In my time with the program there were ever shifting expectations about who we were to serve – the officers?  The community? Both? And ever changing direction, or lack of direction, on how to do this.  The chaplain program was never, to my knowledge, introduced to the officers and staff of MPD in any meaningful way.  This has led to resistance and mis-understandings that have undermined a program that could be helpful and healing.  (See addendum) I have also worked with the Police Activity League, and experienced three different leaders in as many years.  Constantly shifting leadership results in unclear expectations, a lack of strong relationships, and makes it nearly impossible to evaluate and promote programs.  If we continue to do things the same way we will get the same results. Training I am grateful that we are participating in the National Initiative project.  On going, annual training for everyone in the department on implicit bias is crucial.  And it seems clear that anyone who interfaces with the public should receive Critical Incident Training to prepare for situations involving people who are experiencing a mental health crisis.  De-escalation.  I’ve heard this phrase used as a strategy when citizens are not cooperating with police: “Ask ‘em, tell ‘em, make ‘em”.  Offering folks a choice somewhere in those steps often results in the wished for outcome.  A “Use of Deadly Force” training was described to me in detail.  It had everything to do with educating the officer about which situations might result in a lawsuit and very little about how to avoid deadly force in the first place.  We can do better. I’ve been told that “hazing” is sometimes a part of an officer’s introduction to the department.  No good can come of hazing.   Officers may need some training on Community Engagement.  Chatting with the public does not come naturally to everyone.  Some officers are great at this, but I have also witnessed officers standing in a group, with their backs to the crowd at events that have been sponsored by the community specifically to promote community engagement.  If we continue to do things the same way we will get the same results. Strengths and Resources • The work of Carla Nielson and the East African officers in Cedar-Riverside is outstanding.  Community policing at its best. • The DID program and its staff – They truly contribute to the quality of life in downtown Mpls. • The fact that we have a Community Engagement team is encouraging.  I have suggested the strategy of “Respectful Conversations” as a useful tool.  This also might be an area in which chaplains could advise and assist. • http://www.mnchurches.org/respectfulcommunities/respectfulconversations.html • Bike Cops for Kids – Supporting creative initiatives like this that are both privately and publicly funded is a great step forward. • The PAL programs are good – great intentions, loving leadership.  Wise and compassionate MPD staff that I have witnessed in action:  Charlie Addams Medario Arradondo Willie Wright Cheryl Goodman Richard Sheldon James Novack Marshall Collier Paul Huynh Mike Kirchen Christie Nelson Rowena Holmes Carla Nielson Mohammed Abdullahi Abdiwahab Ali  Donald Harris Todd Savageau Gio Feliz I am sure that there are many, many others.  I note these leaders as men and women whom I believe can assist with the “cultural shift” that is needed to keep us all safe. Addendum Below is some basic info that I believe it would be helpful for rank and file officers to understand about the chaplain program. Ideally this info would be delivered annually, by arranging a time outside of roll call for officers to meet their precinct chaplain.  Perhaps it could be included in training event.  Allow chaplain to introduce her/himself, explain the program, answer questions. Allow 30 minutes. Program intro should include: Current chaplain job duties/expectations. Current “call –out”, death notification availability and info on how chaplains are contacted. Current ride along policy – Ride alongs can be a great strategy.  How they are assigned needs more thought and consistency. Benefits:  Chatting with a chaplain can be a healthy, safe way to acknowledge stress or trauma or pride and feelings of accomplishment. Ride alongs allow chaplains to witness the amazing work and the incredible stresses of police work.   Challenges: There are MANY reasons why an officer would prefer not to do a ride along. Listing these could be a helpful activity during program introduction.  Acknowledge these reasons, yet ask officers to remain open to an occasional ride along. Confidentiality – “What you say to the chaplain, stays with the chaplain.” Role of Chaplains for officers:  Chaplains are not therapists.  Chaplains are good listeners, and can offer wisdom and resources.  Many of them can offer guidance for “life moments” such as marriage, birth or death.   Role of Chaplain in Community – Chaplains serve as listeners, liaisons and leaders.   How can chaplains serve both?  - It’s not easy.  However, if we want to move from the polarization of recent events then clearly we need folks who are willing to stand in the middle.  Chaplains are willing to live in the tension of “not taking a side”.  They love and listen and are willing to keep loving and listening. Prayer  - Prayer is a tool that the MPD includes in its toolkit.  This is clear from the inclusion of prayers at MPD ceremonies, and from its commitment to a Chaplain program.  Prayer is an option.  If prayers are said at an MPD event officers are not required to participate.  Prayer can also provide calm, and re-direction of energy, during moments of stress and crisis. Chaplains do their best to offer prayers that are inclusive and supportive. The role of faith - The MPD acknowledges that faith is a part of community life yet does not impose any beliefs on anyone.  Chaplains help the MPD maintain relationships with faith communities.  They can also offer spiritual guidance without directing folks to a particular denomination or belief system.  Police work can wear and tear at the soul.  Chaplains are a resource for this wear and tear.   Chaplains are an optional resource – Kind of like an employer offering a discounted gym membership as a benefit.  You can choose to use, or decline – as you wish.  Even if you are asked to accept a ride along, you are free to engage with the chaplain as you wish."
"6/30/2020 11:15:15 AM",-17,"","","I DO NOT support the proposal to disband the police force and change the city's charter.  The Council's actions since the murder of George Floyd are irresponsible and reckless, and have caused further chaos.   The council has offered no evidence to citizens to support their conclusion that the entire police department is incapable of reform.  Instead, they developed their own proposal without due process of community opportunity to review. It disturbs me the Council offers no acknowledgement or support to the police chief and his department, who place themselves in danger to protect and serve.   Instead, the action of  Chauvin, and inaction of three other officers, is used to characterize the entire department.   Isn't this how systemic racism works?    I DO NOT support giving the Council complete control any form of ""Community of safety & violence Prevention"" department.    We cannot have a safe community without law enforcement.  We need police reform, and education as to what citizens can realistically expect from police, and leadership that speaks out against citizens hurling insults and objects at police,  failing to obey orders from police, burning and looting.   We all need to do better and support positive changes while respecting each other.    Based on the Councils ideology.  it would be exceedingly dangerous to put them in charge, and I have no confidence with any action that gives them more power.  Checks and balances are critical, and the council is seeking to  eliminate anything that gets in the way of this ill-conceived proposal."
"6/30/2020 11:15:17 AM",8,"","","I am very interested in this proposed charter amendment to remove the police department and establish a community of safety and violence prevention department. As we have seen during the recent protests, police brutality is an issue that affects many Minneapolis residents, many Minnesotans, and many people across the country.  I do not believe the police as an institution can be reformed into what the residents of Minneapolis want. Instead, I support divesting from the police department and spreading those funds among public health initiatives (including comprehensive mental health services), education, and the new safety and violence prevention department.  I do NOT want this new department to simply be a renamed police force. I will support an amendment that seeks to imagine a future where community supports each other, not polices each other. I've seen so much community support and care over the last couple months, and know that it's possible to build a future that will be equitable for all Minneapolis residents."

"6/30/2020 11:17:30 AM",-5,"","","This is ridiculous. There are not enough officers to police now! For example, what is the point of lowering speed limits if there are no traffic cops? Just changing the signs will do nothing. Making sure police are trained properly is an answer. Making sure people who become officers are not people who like to boss others around, rather than negotiate is an answer.  Making sure there are consequences to any improper actions by any officer is an answer. We should not be trying to throw the baby out with the bath water."
"6/30/2020 11:17:51 AM",3,"","","I admire the bold action to try this out and support the effort to disband and replace the police with something different. However, I feel we are doing a terrible job with messaging and are scaring the living daylights out of some of our older residents, visiting suburbanites, or, frankly, anyone living outside our liberal bubble of MPLS. These are the same people who misunderstood and were therefore irrationally apposed to the 2040 plan forcing a number of concessions. We did a terrible job promoting that plan to sceptics and I foresee this police reform plan being an even tougher sell. We need to cite the the example of Camden. We need to explain WHY we're doing this, we need to reassure people that safety will be maintained. With so few details known, people are going to fill in the blanks with their worst fears or highest aspirations depending on which 'side' we are already on.  I wish y'all luck with this, you're gonna need it."
"6/30/2020 11:18:22 AM",-5,"","","The president of city council said ""If you're white and you're feeling unsafe right now, just know that those feelings come from privilege."" She (and the rest of city council) have done nothing to assure the residents of Minneapolis that we will be safe, they have no regard for my or my family's safety. Minneapolis has already been declining over the last several years to the point that I (and many others) avoid going downtown. Defunding the police will only make it worse. People will travel to Minneapolis to commit crimes. Honestly, this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard of. If Minneapolis is insane enough to actually defund the police, I will be leaving very quickly. And if your answer to that is ""good riddance"" then you just proved my point, you do not represent me."

"6/30/2020 11:22:09 AM",-1,"","","It is not a coincidence that the residents who need the police the most are the ones who are completely against removal of them from their communities. I understand wanting to reallocate police funds to mental health and education but THERE IS NO PLAN! Your commitment means jack shit if there isn't a plan that covers your bases. How will you guarantee that social workers can provide adequate services when any person worth a damn will be more than incentivized to join private industry? How will increasing education funding make a difference when the problem isn't just the schools, it's at home? What's the data on the people that have been umbrellaed by government programs. How much tax revenue is spent on them over the course of 1 year? 5 years? 10?  I think the city has to take a deep look at the economic ramifications of their decisions and really make a tough decision about the roles of the government in the day to day life of its constituents. Your heart is in the right place but the execution is far from where it needs to be it. It seems like the more the city has tried to help it has instead hurt. This time feels no different."

Innocent persons will be forced to defend themselves under unimaginable circumstances.  They will have to make split seconds decisions which could get them arrested only to appease the mob control. Additionally, the civil suits will increase exponentially with the immunity defense being weakened because of the intention and reckless conduct of the City Council.  I live in Ohio, but feel for you folks."
"6/30/2020 11:24:10 AM",-2,"","","I am concerned about the language in the charter amendment regarding law enforcement services.  The problem I see at this time is our officers are called upon to handle situations where their training is, at best, not suitable and, at worst (excuse the term), overkill.  Having a wider, public health approach is a terrific idea, *and* I honestly cannot imagine a situation in the future where it would not be advantageous to have officers with appropriate training and equipment available to deal with the most difficult and dangerous situations.  I think the language ""may maintain a division of law enforcement services"" is too soft; I think this division will still be essential and the charter language should reflect that."
"6/30/2020 11:26:25 AM",2,"","","I believe this change is needed in order to move forward with a clear effort to change the way policing is handled in Minneapolis. I support the city council and ask the Mayor to support this change as well. We have spent too much as a city and have gotten too little. I live in North Minneapolis, and policing has made very little impact on the levels of gun violence and I will no longer call the police when help is needed in my community. We need another path."
"6/30/2020 11:26:32 AM",-16,"","","The heroin crisis has not disappeared.  Neither has the opioid crisis.  Cut the police into a rainbows-and-lollipops civil service and you create a power vacuum on the streets.  Something will fill that void, be it local street gangs or more organized criminal structures.  For a model of this look to a lot of cities/towns in Mexico.  (I used to live across the border from Mexico and saw how criminal elements can take over neighborhoods.)  Think it can't happen here?  Fewer police with less initiative will be very attractive to drug cartels and human trafficking groups for the simple reason they look for urban areas where they can operate with little interference.  In a year or two Minneapolis could well be a major mid west hub for those criminal enterprises.   Yes, bad police need to be weeded out and, yes, it would be good to have social service assets available when police are called to mental health disturbances.  But undercutting the police whole-hog, as you are planning on doing, is like planning on doing surgery for a cancerous tumor with a chainsaw rather than a scalpel.  And please spare me the rhetoric about how 'concerned' and 'pro-police' you really are.  As a group the city council cut ties to the police as the city burned.  All to enhance your progressive credentials.   So the bottom line is a police force that is restricted from defending its own precincts is not reliable.  As the massive up-swing in gun violence since the riots has shown.  Citizens now do not believe the cops will be there when 911 is called.  Consequently, more people are getting firearms for self defense -- and this is a major problem because they don't know how to use them properly.  (I'm retired military and know a bit about how much training is needed to make a raw recruit a competent rifleman.)  By the way, the city council should not even think about trying to slip in more gun control.  You will be laughed out of the city and we all know how important public image is to the council members. Leadership is the act of doing what is right, not what is convenient.  The city council has yet to show any leadership."
"6/30/2020 11:26:35 AM",3,"","","Overall, I am in full support of the idea of eliminating the police department from the Charter and creating a new entity to oversee “community safety and violence prevention.”  However, before the Council decides whether to put this issue on the ballot in November, I want the Council to critically analyze whether it thinks enough work has been put in regarding the new Department. For example, has the Council truly received enough public input – namely residents of Minneapolis – on how the new Department is created, how it will (and will not) function, what role will the law enforcement services division play, what role won’t it play, etc. Moreover, has the Council sufficiently engaged with community leaders who have been on the ground talking with those most affected by these issues – what do they need, what don’t they need, what are the biggest problem areas. At this point, I am not sure that there has been enough of this type of dialogue.  Similarly, the public deserves to know what is going on behind closed doors – i.e., what exactly is the Council doing to create this Department, what conversations are they actually having with the community. I think it would be beneficial – both for the actual formation of the new Department and for public trust – to hold at least several public comment hearings that are also streamed online so that people can voice their opinions but also so that the public can physically see the Council hearing these opinions.  Finally, I think the new department itself needs to be more community driven as opposed to city leadership driven – namely that the public should have input – via our right to vote – on who the director of the department is.

"6/30/2020 11:27:36 AM",15,"","","As long time residents of downtown Minneapolis, my wife and I had planned to live out our lives in downtown. Now we are having serious reservations about the safety and future of, what once was, a beautiful vibrant city. Ever since the decision was made to reduce the arrests of people soliciting drugs along Hennepin and the Nicollet Mall, we have seen an increase in such activity and have been approached by people trying to sell us drugs.We're in our mid-seventies and no longer feel safe to walk to Target Field or many of the other restaurants and attractions that made us want to live in the City. The idea that by reducing or eliminating the Minneapolis Police Force is absurd. What is needed is more police, not fewer. The Ordinance (as written) does not seem, in any way, to be thought out. No details, no real plan. It seems you are asking people to give you the power to eliminate the police without any idea what would replace them and ""trust you"" to provide protection and security. We'll be voting ""NO"". I would like to hear someone's response to my concerns and I hope I do not receive some sort of happy ass, feel good form letter. Thank you."
"6/30/2020 11:28:13 AM",-3,"","","If it's true that 3 or 4 of the current city council members are charging taxpayers $4500/d for their security then it's time to vote them out or recall them. This is outrageous. Large and important sections of our city are in ruin and you (they) are selfishly worrying about increasing bike routes and plastic bags oh! and charging taxpayers for your (their) security.  I'm with Jos. Anthony cf. Strib 6/25. It's time to change the city charter so that one person, the mayor, is in charge not you (them) 13 so called city council members. Other than that, get to work, do what StP council members are doing: get out to the ruined neighborhoods, note carefully the huge needs of our immigrant, Native American, white etc. neighbors and use taxpayer $$ for that. Show up where you are needed and do your job for God's sake!!!!"

"6/30/2020 11:31:38 AM",1,"","","I do think this amendment is the best route to taking strong reform for the police, as long as we have a transitional plan in place and also communicate with the community what is going to happen. I think quite a few people are scared that they’re losing the police during the recent uptick in calls, but I think it needs to be communicated that this amendment just allows for future changes to happen while creating reform to prevent incidents from happening in the mean time. Again, I strongly support this."
"6/30/2020 11:31:43 AM",-10,"","","Do NOT do this. As a lifelong resident of MPLS I believe this is an overreaction and a gross under serving of the residents.  We need a strong police force to protect and serve EVERYONE.  There are issues that have been there for years, now, the national and world spotlight is on MSP you decide to make a radical change.  How about doing something really novel and hold all of us to a higher standard.  We can have a highly functioning, respectful police department that addresses concerns swiftly and with consequences.  What has been happening in Mpls over the last month in Powderhorn Park and near North side is unacceptable and frankly underserves all of the community.  Autonomous zones and turning the other cheek to violent acts is a foreshadowing of what is in store for us.   This reaction is as disturbing as the action that caused the riots I. Minneapolis.  Stop the crazy, get training for the cops, dismantle the union, fire Kroll, make the cops live in the community.  I think it’s shameful you spent city money on private security, that only validates my point. We need need people to keep order and protect us.  On a separate note address systematic racism through action in terms of education, opportunity and white people like me recognizing their privilege."
"6/30/2020 11:32:27 AM",0,"","","We don't need to rename the police and continue the same injustices. End qualified Immunity, redistribute the budget to social programs like education, housing, family services, and public health. Sell off the military surplus the MPD used to attack our people. Require any peace keeping public servant to live in Minneapolis, require them to keep their body camera on or face criminal penalty, give the people of Minneapolis power of citizens review of the police department and require external handling of complaints against officers so those with long histories of brutality won't be allowed to remain on our streets because of some code of silence. For too long has the MPD acted like an outside occupying force, terrorizing the people of Minneapolis. I am STRONGLY in support of eliminating the MPD."
"6/30/2020 11:32:39 AM",2,"","","To Whom it May Concern; Before moving to abolish your police department, I would hope that the city would exercise emotional restraint and attempt to approach the matter of public safety with a level head and pure intentions.    What has happened to George Floyd was a tragedy, one that could have been avoided and prevented. Evil exists in our world and it is for this exact reason that law enforcement must exist. No department, regardless of how scrutinized, will ever be free from the clutches of tyranny, greed and abuse of power. It is for this reason our founding fathers sought to create a new nation, one founded in liberties with checks and balances against those who we saw fit to govern us. Although this Union is not perfect, far from it, the diligent thought and care which was undertaken to see its success has been rewarding beyond any other measure.  With this in mind, I would humbly ask that those who reside at the table of power in the city of Minneapolis consider what they seek to accomplish by abolishing their department of law enforcement and inquire within themselves if by doing so, the greatest good might be dealt to the greatest number of people. Should the apple tree be hewn down on the behalf of a few poisoned fruit? After all, it has shaded so many from the scorching heat of evil and provided stability for all animals and birds to perch amongst its branches.  Question everything. Never give in to a mob. Seek to protect the very people who placed you in the positions you are in today. Protect the weak.  -Concerned Citizen"
"6/30/2020 11:32:54 AM",5,"","","I do not know why we need a charter amendment to do the right thing. I think that by appropriating budget money and spending it where it will matter (prevention, protection, support) we can get a lot more done without taking on a contentious, us- vs-them situation. Reform can work - and it can work well. The fact that it hasn't worked in the past has more to with the council's response to budget requests and personnel requirements than with the city's charter.    I do not think we need to abolish the police - and I would guess that I have that in common with a large majority or my follow residents. I support Chief Arrandondo, and I think we should try to find a way to make meaningful reform possible without gutting things completely. We don't need grandstanding or position - we need hard, steady work toward reform and a serious method for civilian oversight and review - and accountability. I believe all of that can be accomplished without having to reform the charter."

What is your plan on how to replace the police department?  You make a decision to move forward with this but offer no explanation on what the future will look like.  Investing in preventative measures sounds great on paper, but getting down to brass tacks, how are you going to deal with the increased violence we now see in downtown Minneapolis?  Your very actions have seemed to embolden the bad guys!  For right now, I have no desire to go down town Minneapolis.  In fact, I will make an effort to avoid downtown."

When the City Council is asked questions about what the new organization would be, they do not have answers or do not want to share the information. This is getting the cart before the horse. You do not get rid of something before you know what will replace it. The Police Dept does need to improve. Maybe make more community service positions. Better training, better visibility, change the review and disciplinary process. The police Dept should NOT report the City Council. Too many people involved. It should report to the Mayor. The City Council has turned down funding requests from the Police Dept and ignored the suggestions for changing the Police Dept in recent years. Now when an issue occurs they want to take over. Wrong. We need more and better policemen and women. I do not want this question to go on the ballot until other alternatives or the proposal has more details."
"6/30/2020 11:36:39 AM",-12,"","","I support the City Council's proposed charter amendment and their efforts to dismantle the existing police department and replace it with a new agency that will protect and serve ALL residents of our city. For decades the MPD has operated with impunity and failed in its stated purpose. Instead, MPD has used terror against African Americans (and Native Americans) and -- in tandem with other institutions -- maintained separate and unequal spheres for whites and non-whites in work, residence and leisure. As a white resident of South Minneapolis, I benefited materially from this soft apartheid. It must stop, and replacing the MPD is one key step in this process.  I trust my elected representatives in the City Council, and know that they are not saying there will be no protection from violent crime, but that more will be invested in non-violent responses to social problems.

"6/30/2020 11:41:12 AM",-4,"","","I am writing to inform you of my dismay of how the city council is planning to  ‘Dismantle the MPD’ initiative has been handled.   This City Council has appeared to pander to the media and listen to only one group; not all constituents, which is what the job entails and for what my taxes pay.  I believe their actions and planned actions are and will cause grave consequences to the businesses and safety of the residents of this city. I believe that the Proposed Charter amendment related to community safety and violence prevention should be something that is discussed with the community, with law enforcement and voted on by the community before the City Council removes the Police Department as a Charter Department, Article VII and Article VIII.  If you are planning to have year-long community engagement and input in this process, then why do we need to make this change now?  The City Council does not need more power over this process, especially since they do not include the community they serve in the process.  All council members have repeatedly ignored constituents input or requested feedback through polling that doesn’t allow for alternative opinions, to justify his policy decisions. The recent acts of Council Members have made me lose trust in these city leaders. Based on how this situation has been handled, it appears the agenda is not about color of skin or equality, it is about the agendas and political pursuits of the City Council. If past behavior is any sign of the future, then I will make my voice heard at the polls when the time comes."

I am in favor of making needed changes within the police department to ensure the safety and equality of all citizens. I am in favor of holding the department and individual officers accountable for behavior that is not in line with the idea of equal justice for all. I am in favor of officers being an integral part of the city, such as living within the city they police. I want to see greater community interaction between officers and all citizens.  The City Council's response to remove the Police Department is reckless and distinctly lacking thought and planning."
"6/30/2020 11:42:41 AM",3,"","","My biggest concern is that the city plans to remove all law enforcement. While there are bad cops, removing all officers is not a solution I want to see. There's got to be a balanced, middle ground solution where police officers are held accountable and our community is served and protected appropriately based on our needs (domestic abuse, mental health, panhandling, etc). Expectations are set by our leaders...so I do believe this runs deeper than one city department. Further, having heard that our tax dollars are being spent on security for three city council members is enough evidence for me that they believe in protection for themselves. Why push the opposite on its residents? Doing so will secure my vote against them at election time."
"6/30/2020 11:43:06 AM",-1,"","","I support reform, not dismantling the Minneapolis police. There are many parts of the criminal justice system that require a licensed peace officer. For example, who will obtain search warrants for DNA swabs for sexual assault cases? Who will run a canine unit to find suspects that have left the scene? Who will submit violent cases to prosecutors for charging? It isn’t as simple as sending social workers or counselors to handle still active incidents. Please work with Chief Rondo to give Minneapolis the police force they deserve."

In the past 3 weeks I have been awoken almost every Night to gunfire and carnage as a result of your poor decisions to give criminals carte Blanche in ruling this city. Since your campaign to ruin or city has begun, a man has been killed 2 blocks from my home, the shot spotters are going off every night and you sit up in your ivory tower of hypocrisy with your $4500/ day private security making immensely short-sighted decisions in an effort to enrage a cultural war than to protect my personal property and family members.

The oversight committee at the City should continue and you should allow those who have made a complaint against MPD to be part of it. Right now you can't join if you made a complaint within 5 years.

Police reform is possible, however, now we see why the democrats, who've had control of Minnesota for decades, did nothing to enact police reform to solve issues. We now are awake to the goal to subvert our constitution. We are aware that former Mayor Betsy Hodges and former Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton signed Minneapolis up as a member of the Strong Cities Network. We're aware that under the SCN, law-enforcement measures for member cities will come from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and the United Nations, and not from the U.S. Constitution and locally elected officials and the laws governing them. This revelation and the official documentation proving it has become widespread among Minnesotans and all citizens of the United States. The attempts that are being made to subvert our constitution are by law crimes. Continued effort at subversion of the Constitution and city charters constitute criminal activity as per 18 U.S. Code CHAPTER 115—TREASON, SEDITION, AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-115"
"6/30/2020 11:50:38 AM",10,"","","Hello, I fully a support developing a community safety department in lieu of a police department. Working as a community social worker I've seen ways that police presence agitates situations and as someone who lives in south Minneapolis I've seen the police be bullies who feel they have the power to treat people however they want.  Here are a few things that feel very important as we move forward. Requiring that people who work in the safety department live in the community seems important to me, or at least requiring that a large majority live here. Not only will it give people a sense of ownership (this is my neighborhood and these are my neighbors.) but they will also know more people in the community if they live and work here. When I worked in Dakota County the police officers knew us and knew many of our clients which hugely impacted how they handled situations. I also think it's important to look at what professional's training fit the different police responsibilities when the new department is being set up. A mediator, drug and alcohol specialist, and mental health practitioners all have different focuses that make them an expert in certain areas. A well rounded team of people will provide different perspectives in the department and allow workers to focus on furthering their skills development in a focused area. Police officers are expected to do so many things yet aren't well trained in many of them. Breaking down those tasks will create a safer system. I like that the proposal changes the title of police officers. We need a new start and new titles for the remaining police type role will help some embrace the plan. A piece that may not fit in the step of changes but is so very important that I want to bring it up now is a continual fight against racism. All professions, my own included, are steeped in racism. We need to find a way to challenge the ingrained systemic racism in all our professions on a personal level but I wonder if there are ways to focus on this in the new department. Because it's a safety and violence department whoever is hired will be placed in situations were racism could create traumatizing or dangerous situations. Maybe it's ongoing training for all in the department or a racism specific review board, or something else but it has to be continually addressed until we change the whole dynamic of racism in our society.  I know we're at a stage where ideas are still being put together and things are vague to some degree. As things move forward being transparent and as detailed as possible will help people who are on the fence or feelings uncertain. Also the more information you can give us the more community members can share with each other. We are ready to be a part of the process and want to have conversations about these changes. Thank you for the work you've put into this important change! I appreciate you asking for feedback and thank you for reading my statement."
"6/30/2020 11:51:31 AM",8,"","","YES absolutely we need a new department that is truly invested in community safety.

We are 2nd responders to violent crimes to include Domestic Violence, shootings and Homicides to help the victims get the resources they need, as well as trauma care.  What the Council is suggesting in place of the police is DANGEROUS. EMT, Paramedics and the Fire Department won't go into certain calls until the scene is rendered safe for them. The Violence with Guns CRISIS has now spread throughout the City. People involved in this Violence are following what's happening closely and totally disrespecting police officers responding to calls. What the City Council is suggesting is dangerous, especially for the BLACK Community. This is the time when cooler heads are needed. We have a Chief who IS shifting the culture in MPD with no support from this Council. I have NEVER seen this before. Changing 150 years of a culture does not happen in 3 years, but the things this Chief is doing IS moving Minneapolis in the right direction. When it was decided to make Minneapolis a BIGGER City we should have expected more crime and violence. As it stands MPD did not grow as the City grew nor as the crime grew. This is the time to FULLY invest in the police and the community, as PARTNERS for change. My team has been on-scene dogging bullets, is that really what we want in Minneapolis? Telling people they are White Supremacist if they use their tax payers right to call 911.  This Divesting/Dismantling/Abolitioning talk will lead Minneapolis to be the first Stand Your Ground City within a State.... Will the great Citizens and many visitors be indemnified?

I believe that most people agree that changes need to be made, but there could potentially be more safety issues for Minneapolis residents without a police presence. I am fearful of the thought of not having a police presence to deter crime. Let’s look at models of other cities. Let’s work alongside law enforcement professionals to support the public with domestic abuse, addiction, and mental health situations that arise, and that result in 911 calls. I think it makes sense to provide additional support to those calling in for help, whether it be a clinical psychologist, social worker or other professional that can be part of the response team, along with law enforcement.

How will it operate differently?  Will people in this department have guns?  if not, how will they deal with criminals that have guns?  if yes, then how are they different from the police we have now?  It seems like removing the Police is a reactionary decision that has not been well thought out.  It's a solution without truly describing a problem.  If a problem is truly defined, that can lead to a different solution.  Right now we have a situation where in south Minneapolis fireworks are going off every night.  People are more cavalier about not following traffic laws.  I'm more concerned for my safety than I have ever been and that is with the police still in place.  It's all going in the wrong direction.  My day job is in medical device engineering.  When we create a lifesaving solution, we start with problem definition AND risk/benefit analysis for the solution in mind.

Funding instead needs to go to mental health and domestic violence crisis centers, violence de-escalation services, drug counselors, affordable housing, vocational training, free childcare, free healthcare, food shelves, and other organizations that provide tools for people to stay on their feet. Crime happens most frequently when there is a lack in security. If the city can provide financial, well-being, housing, healthcare, and food security to its residents, crime levels WILL go down. If the MPD is abolished, crime levels WILL go down. We have a beautiful city for many of our residents. Let's share the wealth to create a great place for all.

"6/30/2020 12:11:26 PM",-5,"","","I fully support the city council's move to replace the Minneapolis police department with a safety and violence prevention department. I live just outside the city (in St. Louis Park) in an almost exclusively white neighborhood with a strong sense of community but have family who live in Minneapolis proper. My neighborhood is safe not because we have a strong police presence (I can't remember the last time I saw them drive down my street), but because we have excellent access to resources - schools, housing, parks, grocery stores, healthcare (both mental and physical). Not only do the police make up an outsize portion of the city budget (money that should be dedicated to institutions supporting the thing things I listed above), the fact that the role of police has expanded far beyond its scope is a detriment to both the police and citizens alike. Minorities feel unsafe in their communities; police officers have to do things they don't have adequate training to do, and do it with a gun on their hip which puts everyone involved on edge.  As a white person indoctrinated into the racist society that we live in, the idea of removing the institution of the police department is scary, just as any move from the status quo is scary. But it's unlikely to have much effect at all on my life. I'll continue to never see police drive down my street. I'll continue to not be pulled over. I'll continue to not worry about being arrested while sitting in a park, or a parked car. It will however, have an enormous effect on the lives of the black and brown people who by and large bear the brunt of the current system.  I know that the framework for the Community of Safety and Violence Prevention Department is currently vague but that lack of clarity is not a reason to not move forward. The US constitution was signed  years after the revolutionary war. That didn't seem to stop them make a much bigger institutional change (starting a new country). We won't know exactly the form this new department should take until we see what problems arise.   People just want to make sure that if they have a problem there will be someone to answer the phone when they call 911, and someone to help in the event that they need it. I am confident that this will happen even if the department (as currently constituted) is disbanded. Please don't let the inevitable backlash diminish your resolve. This is going to be a difficult process and naysayers will be loud every step of the way, but it's a step in the right direction.

"6/30/2020 12:16:26 PM",32,"","","My response is in the Word attachment below. Without a clear and concise well though out plan, my vote will be no. Attachment: Over the years, we have seen more and more unnecessary police brutality in the news. George Floyd’s death was the straw that broke the camel’s back and the whole nation has reached a boiling point on racial injustice. After watching the horrific video, it is clear that his death should have been avoided. As a result, it demands changes within our City Council, the Minneapolis Police Department, as well as community resources.  The City Council’s Transforming Community Safety Resolution is vague, hasty, and an irresponsible response that leaves more questions than answers for its constituents of Minneapolis. Sadly, I do not trust that this City Council is capable of the leadership that we really need right now in order to realize a clear, concise, and well thought out plan for the future safety of Minneapolis. Again, this City Council’s leadership leads me to more questions than answers:  • City Council opens this Resolution up by placing blame on the Minneapolis Police Department for the leading cause of death for people of color and other sexual preferences without factual statistics to back this statement up. Per the Star Tribune, 22 blacks (and 29 people of color) have died in the city of Minneapolis over 20 years with a population of around 460,000. So, this opening statement is highly inaccurate. • This proposed City Charter Amendment lacks clear answers and recommendations. Why would the public would want to vote on an idea rather than a concrete and well thought out plan first with the hopes that the City Council will lead successfully? How much money will be allocated to this program? What will success look like? What will this phone triage look like? • There is no clarity on who would be the head of this new Public Safety department. Would this person be a civilian that is in charge of these peace officers that may or may not be armed? This person would have to cooperate with 13 different Council members with very different agendas per their own wards. Would this person work with each ward Council Member individually or collectively? How long would this person be appointed for? What kind of extensive experience and education would this person need in order to successfully manage an entire triage system of different departments for this Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention? What does the job description and yearly goal objectives look like for this person?  • Per the current City Charter, “the City Council is required to fund a police force of at least 0.0017 employees per resident” for the city of Minneapolis (Minnesota Spokeman-Recorder). Under this new Minneapolis Charter Amendment, there is no indication of how many peace officers would be employed and remain available throughout the city to ensure proper safety of the citizens of Minneapolis. Would these individuals be armed? Unarmed? Include a portion of the Police Department or not?  • This new Amendment would give even more power to the City Council when it appears that they have not exhausted and/or reviewed the available existing resources. Per the Star Tribune, Mayor Frey asked for more police officers in 2019. The City Council said no, but did not come up with any creative alternatives/suggestions/studies for the Mayor and no response or explanation to the public. How do we know with this increased power to control this new department and the budgets that the City Council will properly lead this successfully? Separation of leadership and these budgets ensures that public officials cannot abuse this power in the future. As an Accountant, I understand the need for complete separation of duties.   • Currently, the City Council already has the ability to work with the various community organizations that are already put in place. For example, Police Conduct Oversight Commission, why did the City Council cancel 7 out of 12 of the monthly required meetings in 2019? Why has this continued into 2020? Per the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, the City Council is required BY LAW to meet monthly with the PCOC. In the past, PCOC has conducted studies and made recommendations. Most recently, PCOC made the recommendation of a co-responder pilot project for mental health issues, why cannot we expand on this if necessary for all non-violent calls? Again, I do not feel that they are making use of their existing available resources.  • Similar to the PCOC, “several other community organizations have made at least specific 40 recommendations” to make changes to the Minneapolis Police Department. Why can’t the City Council really dive into and review these requests from these community organizations? (Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder).  • Per the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, in 2019 the contract between the city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department has ended. Why not use this as a bargaining tool to achieve the potential changes that the public desires? Suspension of MPD contracts with various entities throughout the city has a profound effect that could potentially generate a greater bargaining advantage within the union and police department. • The majority of the City Council is a DFL based Council and it is interesting that they seem to be cutting out the union with this effort which goes against the principles that the DFL was founded on. In the case of Camden, these peace officers removed the union to reduce costs, but have since regained a union. This resulted in raising the cost again of their police force budget to equal 1/3 the total of city’s budget (Zack Guzman’s Yahoo Finance article.) • Why don’t the Council members encourage the public to get involved in City Council meetings and PCOC meetings? Why can’t the City Council hold more public meetings? Be present in the community to hear its constituents? I know this may not be the case for all, but Lisa Bender has been conveniently absent. She conveniently communicated with her constituents over Twitter which not all Minneapolis residents have access to or potentially could be aware of.  • Just as we should not judge the protesters on their worst acts throughout the city, so should we not judge the Minneapolis Police Department, by one policeman’s act.   In order to regain the trust with the community again, the Minneapolis Police Department needs to change the public’s view which will take a lot of time and constant reform efforts. This means being available in relaxed situations throughout the community by participating in community based projects, meetings, and gatherings. Also, it would show an incredible amount of respect if the Minneapolis Police Department could show an act of solidarity and respect towards George Floyd in some manner. State licensure requirements should be changed to extend the initial training programs before graduation, as well as continuing officer training, de-escalation tactics. The City Council should fully explore expanding its available resources in coordination with the Minneapolis Police Department for non-violent and mental health issues.  In conclusion, the City Council lacks serious leadership, mismanages its own developmental funds which could be redirected towards this racial inequality prevention, and has not fully exhausted all its readily resources already available nor has it really listened to its Minneapolis constituents before making a blanket decision."
"6/30/2020 12:16:41 PM",7,"","","As a citizen of Minneapolis, I would like clearer direction about how the ""new"" Community of Safety & Violence Prevention Department would work before the charter amendment is voted on.

"6/30/2020 12:16:52 PM",-7,"","","I think this is a bad, bad idea. While I do not live in Minneapolis, my two adult daughters do. We have enjoyed going to breweries and an occasional concert in Minneapolis. I assure you we will not be visiting Minneapolis to visit our daughters or take part in activities in the city and spending money with the local businesses, unless there is a police department to protect us. Community members are not qualified and equipped to deal with all of the things a police officer does. The Council is out of touch - it is very ironic and hypocritical that they want to disband the police department, but then they hire a private security company on the the tax payers dime - or should I say  450,000 dimes (per day) !

I also strongly believe that systemic changes are necessary, such as housing support, access to healthcare and mental health services, and other human rights, and that these changes will ultimately reduce crimes and create lasting community safety."

Why do they deem necessary for protection but not the citizens of MN?"
"6/30/2020 12:17:36 PM",10,"","","I am very supportive of making reforms that will ensure unbiased laws and enforcement within our community.  Whatever approach has been taken to date is clearly inadequate as demonstrated by the horrific death of George Floyd.  In speaking with many across the spectrum of our community, I am convinced that there are many well-intentioned folks who want to be part of achieving positive change.  That said, as I read the charter markup of Articles 7 and 8, I am left with deep concerns that the council does not grasp the magnitude of the challenge in front of us.  Major reorganizational change requires depth of planning, concrete objectives, and clarity in setting success criteria.  The charter changes are vague and the speed at which this council is expecting to enact the amendment, which includes the complete dismantling of the police department and then design, staffing, and training of the new holistic organization seems unrealistic.  I have been involved in several organization restructuring efforts in the private sector, and done right, it takes at least a year given the key components of the Galbraith Model, i.e. Strategy, Structure, Processes & Capabilities, Reward System/Metrics, and People & Learning/Training Practices (see attachment).  There is an old adage in organization redesign which cautions to ensure that the new problems created by your redesign solution are more manageable than those you started with.  Given the magnitude of our social justice challenges, we must make major changes, but let's not underestimate the the effort this will take.  I would propose that we move very fast to reform the current police department, including an overhaul of the union contract, training, hiring/firing, accountability, etc, while thoughtfully designing the new Community Safety and Violence Prevention Department, which will take longer to do right.  We should seek input from other cities in designing the new department based on proven success models.  Finally, I am very concerned about what I interpret to be the weakening of the Mayor's role.  In my experience, cities that have weak mayors are too indecisive and slow in implementing change as they rely on management by committee within city councils. Again, I applaud the council's intent in pushing for change, but respectfully, it appears that the thinking/planning is inadequate.  Yes, please attack the issues with a sense of urgency, but ensure that the solutions are well thought out and executed with excellence.  Thank you."

I encourage the Charter commission to go further.

Why not just consider adding the community safety and violence prevention department to the city and work with the Minneapolis police department to create  a process to coordinate efforts. Why is it one or the other? I will try to sell my house in Minneapolis as soon as I possibly can if there is no police department in the city of Minneapolis.

Fewer low level drug arrests? Fewer complaints against armed police for inappropriate conduct in interactions or arrests? I just want to hear more specifics as we move forward.  I would like continued visible effort on the part of those, who are accountable (city council, mayor) to provide information online, papers, emails, etc on each step."
"6/30/2020 12:19:57 PM",5,"","","I support the idea of reforming the police department but not removing the police department. If anything, the police department budget should be substantially increased and an emphasis placed on increasing training and hiring/retaining of high caliber public servants.  Additionally, all of this is extremely premature. No solid proposals have been provided for review and debate. Instead, all we have is this nebulous idea of replacing the police department. How are people supposed to make such a consequential decision without knowing the core details of the proposal?"
"6/30/2020 12:19:59 PM",1,"","","I do not know if this will be a city-wide vote or a county-wide vote, but I believe that only residents of Minneapolis should be able to vote on this matter."
"6/30/2020 12:20:03 PM",12,"","","In order for the CSVPD to be something other than another corrupt force w/a better-sounding name, it must be funded ENTIRELY from voluntary donations from the people in Minneapolis.   I recommend making the CSVPD a standard tax-exempt NPO, funded entirely by donations from the people in Minneapolis, that would do all the policing for the city.  The NPO would have a permanent, irrevocable charter that would guarantee an equal vote in how the organization would be run to all those who donated a certain min amount of $$ to it each month/year.     Without the people directly having the power of the purse (i. e. the ability of each person in the city to withdraw his/her share of funding at will), wealthy entities (i. e. the police union and/or those backing its agendas) will quickly buy influence to make the CSVPD favor their interests, thereby neutralizing any reform it was intended to create. In other words, it would be a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, and not worth the effort or anyone's vote. Recreating a new monster in better clothes isn't reform."
"6/30/2020 12:21:00 PM",0,"","","I do not believe that the Minneapolis City Charter should be changed.  I do not believe that MPD should be defunded and dismantled by the Minneapolis City Council. If placed on the ballot in November to change the Minneapolis City Charter so the Minneapolis City Council can Defund & Dismantle the MPD I will vote against it. My vote will be to keep the Minneapolis City Charter as is."
"6/30/2020 12:21:03 PM",3,"","","I don't have faith in my community leaders to do this well.  I certainly hope we can all get it done together.  I figure, what have we got to lose?  I have not had adequate police protection in my neighborhood for years, even less now, as police are not responding.  (I mean, would you respond now if you were a cop?).  The whole system needs to be redone from top to bottom, and I am concerned that the current city council and ineffective mayor will push through something that will look good politically for them, but will be a disaster for us, the residents of Minneapolis.  I truly hope that I am wrong."
"6/30/2020 12:21:47 PM",1,"","","Please add some way for mental health specialists can also be called in to help, and make guns and other lethal force a last resort."
"6/30/2020 12:21:53 PM",-12,"","","Granted that that the man was choked to death by one officer, with others standing by shows lack of training, of ongoing monitoring the conduct of each and maybe even an unhealthy cover-up attitude by their union leaders.  Rioting,  should have been expected and immediate action taken. Unfortunately our governor and mayor lean towards an apeasement approach. Such did not work in the past.  All not reason to shut down-eliminate the police.  Lack of order, fosters a free for all, brings out the worst in people as we have repeatedly seen.  The lack of fathers, the silence about black on black killings - would that the mothers would rise up for action.  Good things are ahead."
"6/30/2020 12:22:41 PM",11,"","","I request that the Minneapolis Charter Commission conduct an informed and thorough consideration of the City Council’s proposed Police Charter Amendment before taking your action to return it to the Mayor and Council.  Public Safety is a basic city service.  This proposed Charter Amendment would eliminate the Police Department and fundamentally change Minneapolis city government.  This is a substantial change to our city government that should not be rushed or “fast-tracked.”  This is especially the case when we are in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and it is difficult for people to obtain information and participate in deliberations on this critical issue.  I understand that the Charter Commission role is to ensure that the citizenry can make an informed choice.  We rely on you to fulfill that role and appreciate your service to Minneapolis. I oppose the Council’s proposed Police Charter Amendment for several reasons: 1.     It is premature.  The amendment eliminates the Police Department without a plan.  Before the citizenry is asked to vote on the elimination of the Police Department, the Council should have developed their proposal for providing law enforcement, how they intend to implement their plan and a guarantee there will be a smooth transition without a break in public safety protection.  2.    It diminishes Accountability.  The amendment eliminates the responsibility and authority of the Mayor and places oversight in a Director of Community Safety and Violence Prevention who would report to the Council and Mayor.  If there is a Division of Law Enforcement Services, “The Director of Community and Violence Prevention shall appoint the director of the division of law enforcement services, subject to confirmation by official act of the City Council and Mayor.”  This puts in place 15 bosses for a “potential” director of the division of law enforcement.  This diminishes Accountability to the citizenry, adds to bureaucracy, diffuses authority and makes it more distant from citizenry.   3.    It makes no commitment to have a law enforcement services.  The proposed Charter Change removes the current Charter that states:  that the City Council must establish, organize and otherwise provide for these departments ...a police department and states:  “Division of Law Enforcement Services  The Council may maintain a division of law enforcement services, composed of licensed peace officers, subject to the supervision of the department of community safety and violence prevention.”  Under the new Charter language there is no guarantee to the citizenry that there would be licensed police officers serving our city.  Finally, the Council action states: “This ordinance shall take effect on May 1, 2021.”  It is unbelievable that the Council could put the actions contained in this Charter Change into effect in approximately six to seven months.  Recently, the Council passed a resolution that as they redesigned public safety, they would engage the public in a full year of consultation and deliberation.  Has that “gone by the wayside?”  Shouldn’t this public discourse occur before amending the Charter?   Thank you for your consideration of my interpretation of this proposed amendment to our City Charter and concerns."
"6/30/2020 12:25:44 PM",-6,"","","I cant beleive my city is trying to get rid of MPD.  I am a employee of the City of Minneapolis.  I need MPD to keep this city safe.  Stereotyping a whole department on the backs of what 1 person did, in not justice.  Plenty of great cops work for this city.  It seems as the City is going to change a whole police force over what a small minority of the cities residents want.  Majority of the city's residents DO want MPD on the job, along with visitors to Minneapolis, and employees of Minneapolis.  Stereotyping is exactly what we need to get away  from, and the City is doing it in a more public light than anyone.  The City is setting a terrible example.  Can the elected representatives not fix whats wrong here?  This is what they are paid to do, soeak and act on behalf of the city's residents,  and run a city as smooth as possible.  No interject their own PERSONAL AGENDA.   The elected representatives are making Minneapolis a embarrassment.  Do away with all the policy, and follow LAWS that are on the books.  Do whats good, and right for the people that put you in office.  Speak for IS, not on your behalf.  Your persomal agenda doesnt matter, the people's agenda matters.  Quit trying to use Bob Kroll as a scapegoat.  He didnt train the police.  He didnt make policy over the police.  He doesnt lead the police.  The city needs to not blame anybody except for its self.  The world is watching.  Make the right decision on behalf of the people you REPRESENT.  Not what tou want.  They have to live here.  You dont.  Its the residents home.  Its our home.  Quit letting it be destroyed by personal democrat agenda.  Anybody that supports a hate group, like antifa, or the bogalo bois should be removed from their seat ASAP.  Minneapolis doesnt support hate groups."
"6/30/2020 12:26:11 PM",6,"","","I truly can't imagine what you think the streets of Minneapolis would look like without a police department. I certainly would stop coming to Minneapolis. I'm all in favor of groups hugs and that everyone will treat each other the way they should, but lets get real. The people that commit crimes will continue with the city council's blessing. Yes, bad cops need to go and the police union needs to wake up and step up to the plate and clean up their shop."
"6/30/2020 12:27:11 PM",2,"","","Do not remove the police. Change the charter to remove power from the city council and give more power to the mayor. The bureaucracy is far too deep for any meaningful accountability to exist. At least then the mayor can be a leader or get voted out. The president of the city council is not a duly elected office and 13 city council members is too many cooks in the kitchen."
"6/30/2020 12:27:39 PM",-1,"","","No don’t remove the police department. Just make improvements, like don’t let people under 25 have a gun or have that type of job on the force. Also have each MPD officer do 1-2 months every year of community service ( and not be even using their badge/gun during that time), as proposed by one of the people who already proposed this on MPD now"
"6/30/2020 12:28:42 PM",-13,"","","The council members behind this are enemies of the people of Minneapolis & should be executed as the dangerous enemies of society that they are.  Drastically reduce the police dept budget by legalizing  death squads to eliminate all niggers from our city, niggers who despite being only 13% of the U.S. population commit 53% of all murders, 31% of all rapes, 58% of all  violent crimes, etc. Niggers aren't humans. Eliminate them and these council members. Thank you."
"6/30/2020 12:29:12 PM",-6,"","","The Minneapolis city council is the most hypocritical group of people I have ever heard of. Fuck this idea."
"6/30/2020 12:31:21 PM",-4,"","","I believe removing the police department is a bad idea and do not support it. As a resident of Mpls, I used to feel safe and now do not. I will get my conceal and carry license to defend myself. As a single woman this scares the shit out of me. Our property values are dropping, businesses are closing their doors due to safety concerns. The Mpls area has Fortune 500 companies but if people won't move here due to safety reasons, the companies will move as well. And..... WHY IS MY TAX DOLLARS PAYING FOR PERSONAL SECURITY OF COUNCIL MEMBERS?? DO THEY FEEL SAFE?  That is how I feel currently. If i could I would sell my home in mpls, but so close to retirement it doesn't make financial sense. I vote NO to defunding or dismanteling the police department."
"6/30/2020 12:31:23 PM",2,"","","I fully support this move!"
"6/30/2020 12:31:47 PM",0,"","","I believe that a police reform is needed, but it should rather expand the department by adding social workers, psychologists, etc, who can train policemen better deescalate scenarios. They should also join them on calls to mental illness or drug related issues. Most importantly, as long as anyone can get guns it is not realistic to expect the police not to assume that the person(s) they have to deal with will not have guns. This country must follow the footsteps of Australia an ban and confiscate guns."
"6/30/2020 12:31:51 PM",-11,"","","That’s a stupid idea. 1. Many of the residents that would even think about voicing their opinion are not on social media at all so I believe the comments would be very one sided. 2. Absolutely not. Why would you take away the police. They help people every single day. Things from traffic, medical emergencies, crime and so much more. You are already making them not want to be police officers anymore. 3. YES, there are some bad cops which maybe can be dealt with but that’s the same for EVERY other profession out there. You will have a few bad everywhere you go. Come on police risk there lives every day for us and look how we are treating them."
